Elemental Bolt: Nothing?
Elemental Magic: More nothing?
Air Elementalist: Elemental Bolt hit bonus changed from "vulnerable 3 you" to "slide 2", pierce resistance like an O-Sorcerer, F23 improves existing fly speed

Water Elementalist: See above
Something I can't follow with Elemental Escalation

Protector
---------
Too much there, too lazy to care

Less power points...? Not sure what's up with that, might delete that part unless I see a good reason for it in Powers.
