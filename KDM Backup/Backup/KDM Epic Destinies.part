      <specific name="Immortality"> Exarch or Free Agent?
One or more gods might ask that you serve them as a probationary exarch while you work toward your own divine goals. You do not gain any additional abilities for accepting such a position, though you do gain access to a divine connection that might grant you information helpful for completing your quests. On the other hand, you might be required to perform tasks that delay your own goals, or even work at cross-purposes to your goals. No one said godhood would be easy, and acting as a free agent has its own problems as various astral beings take your measure.
Route to Immortality
At least one Demigod has chosen the path to ascension outlined below. Your own route to divinity might be different.
	Divine Ascension: When you complete your final quest, your divine nature yearns to complete your apotheosis. Upon ordering your mortal affairs, the astral flame smoldering within you detonates, consuming all that remains of your mortal flesh.
	The astral flame leaves behind a fledgling god, flush with the power only the truly divine can comprehend and wield. You ascend, blazing like the sunrise (or darkening the skies like an eclipse, if your inclinations run dark). Streaking into the Astral Sea, you are taken up into the realm of an established god who welcomes your strength. You join that god&apos;s pantheon and take on an aspect of the god&apos;s portfolio.
	Soon enough, your transcendent senses discern mortal prayers directed at you. </specific>

Your flesh becomes more than mortal and partakes of the divine vigor enjoyed by the gods themselves. Your epic-level companions are fast, strong, and smart, but you have the spark of godhood that sets you ever so slightly above all mortals.
	Deities from every plane eventually learn your name, your nature, and your goals. Some might monitor your progress to observe whether you possess the mettle of a true demigod, and a few could throw roadblocks in your path. It is in your hands to impress the lords of creation, or disappoint them.
	If you survive, overcome all challenges put before you, and reach the heights of ability achieved by few mortals, you are worthy to ascend to the ranks of the divine.

      <specific name="Immortality"> Divine Allies Bring Divine Enemies
You&apos;re a hero. It&apos;s not bad news that your deity&apos;s enemies want to eradicate you before you can achieve full divinity. Their efforts make your god&apos;s enemies easier to find. If other characters in the adventuring party are not happy about having a cosmological target painted on you, that can be up to the party or the DM to account for in the campaign&apos;s final tier.

Route to Immortality
Many Chosen can live for centuries. However, as a Chosen grows more powerful, the divine fire placed in his or her soul inevitably transfigures the mortal shell. When no vestige of the mortal life remains, it is time for the Chosen to ascend to the celestial court of his or her deity and champion the deity&apos;s cause in the immortal realms. No Chosen remains long in the mortal sphere once he or she has reached the  pinnacle of divinely sponsored power. </specific>

Your deity chooses you to serve as his or her proxy in mortal affairs. You protect your deity&apos;s worshipers, battle your deity&apos;s enemies, and champion your deity&apos;s causes. To suit you for this task, your deity breathes into your soul a spark of divine energy that grants you powers comparable to those of a demigod.
	As with the Demigod epic destiny detailed in the Player&apos;s Handbook, a divine spark increases all your powers. Unlike the Demigod, you are sworn to the service of a particular deity. While operating as an epic hero, you can function as a worldly exarch, receiving advice and commissions from your deity. Alternatively, you could be left on your own, advancing your deity&apos;s cause as you see fit.
	Not all deities have the power or the inclination to elevate a Chosen of their own. Some deities can elevate several Chosen at the same time, although this circumstance is quite rare. Deities most often seek out mortals who are especially faithful for this task, but a few gods seem to take pleasure in selecting undeserving or fickle mortals for their earthly agents. Those around you will probably refer to you using the name of your deity, calling you “the Chosen of Selûne” or “the Chosen of Moradin.”

It is your destiny to stand against the encroaching darkness that threatens to overwhelm the world. You started with battles against goblins and kobolds, but as time passed and your skill grew you faced ever more dangerous foes. Now, you understand that your fate rests far beyond the borders of the lands you have defended. Great powers from other planes threaten the world, and it is up to you to endure their attacks and end their menace forever.
	As an Indomitable Champion, you are almost impossible to sway from your quest. Drawing on reserves of vitality, energy, and vigor, you push on despite your enemies' efforts. Destiny has chosen you to achieve some great deed, and as an epic hero you soldier on despite the obstacles and foes you face.

Your quest is never truly complete, for as long as gods, demons, devils, and primordials battle in the planes, their struggles spill over to the natural world. Some day, when you have hunted the mightiest of the world&apos;s foes to extinction, you can finally find peace, but until then, you must fight on.

Spirit of the Hunt: In time, your body proves a hindrance to your efforts. The threats to the world far too often encompass more than physical destruction. The mightiest of creatures, particularly beasts that originate from beyond the bounds of the cosmos, seek not merely to destroy the world but to transform it. When your mortal life is at an end, you will join the spirits in safeguarding the world. In this form, you can hunt forever. </specific>

As a seeker, it falls to you to search out those who would wreck the natural order. The primal spirits forced the gods and the primordials from the world following the Dawn War and still stand as sentinels against their incursions. You understand better than most the chaos and horror that such beings can unleash. Some gods are benevolent, but others are destructive and evil. The gods must attend to their own affairs and allow the mortal world to follow its own fate.

When you took your first steps along the seeker&apos;s path, you sought out demons, marauding orcs that burned and destroyed at Gruumsh&apos;s behest, and rampant elementals. As these enemies fell before you, your mastery grew. In time, the primal spirits called out to you. There were greater enemies to fight, and you took to the planes to slay them before they could release their horrors upon the world. Titans, aberrations, and other powerful threats fell before you.

Though you have fought and defeated many foes, more and more take their place. You must now seek a new path, one that can help ensure the world&apos;s safety forever. As your skills reach their peak, you must seek out the deadliest hunting grounds, planes where the primal might of the world is but a whisper.

You are a Master of the Eternal Hunt. It is your fate to travel far beyond the world to battle those that threaten it. You might die alone and forgotten in some terrible corner of the Abyss, but if you survive, you will join the spirits as an everlasting guardian of all you value.

You pursue eternal life as an undead creature. Most wizards who search for and achieve easy immortality by way of esoteric necromantic texts are evil, avaricious spellcasters who stop at nothing to achieve their ultimate goals. For some, that goal is lichdom itself. But you have a greater, nobler purpose.
Unlike many who have become liches before you, you have trained your mind to avoid succumbing to the madness that necromantic preservation often brings. For instance, you did not perform the foul ritual that traded your life for animation the moment you found it; you waited until your power was equal to the change. Nor did you accept the aid of Orcus, Demon Prince of the Undead, to empower the ritual, but you waited to find methods outside his control. In doing so, you escaped his touch, though you bear his personal enmity to this day.

You create a magical receptacle that contains your life force. When you die, you and your possessions crumble to dust. A day later, you reappear alive with maximum hit points in a space adjacent to your phylactery, with all your possessions.
Your phylactery can be destroyed. It has 40 hit points and resist 20 to all damage. The typical phylactery is a sealed metal box filled with parchment inscribed with magical phrases written in your blood. Phylacteries can come in other forms, such as rings, gems, or amulets, but they always have 40 hit points and resist 20 to all damage. If your phylactery is destroyed, you can make a new one by spending 10 days and 50,000 gp.

Although your magic derives from drawing energy from the world, you have gained your power through respect and compassion. The primal spirits-ancient powers of the world-have begun to count you among their kin. Through your devotion to the preserver's path, you have transcended mortal boundaries and gained magical prowess. With your newfound power, though, comes the grave responsibility of freeing the world from those who would defile it.
	You feel the pulse of the world and hear the whispers of its spirits. Your soul keeps you in a constant meditative connection with creation. The life force of Athas weaves its threads into your being, linking your mind, body, and soul with the world. Using this connection, you can alter your mortal form to become a bright, winged spirit.

You have always taken what you wanted, especially with regard to magic. Power is for the strong-for those willing to do anything to gain and maintain it. Only weaklings concern themselves with measured ascension. The defilers of legend, including the sorcerer-kings, knew that one must seize power when and where possible, regardless of the consequences.
	Dark fables intrigue you, their words hinting at an ultimate transformation for Athas's most powerful defilers. Through searching or invention, you have discerned the rituals necessary to make this transformation a reality. Perhaps you reached the solution through your independence and cunning. Or maybe you relied on the methods of your predecessors, succeeding where they failed. Whatever the case, you once again proved your superiority over the defilers who came before you.

You reject civilization and the temptations of the cities. You see the city-states groan beneath the sorcerer-kings' tyrannies, and you observe how the people fear to speak out. The city dwellers, even non-slaves, give up freedom and morality for the promise of wealth and protection, but you do not make that choice. You have turned to the wilds to be your haven, abandoning "civilized" folk to the fate they deserve. You hone your body and master your techniques until the day comes when you will be powerful enough to tear down the city walls and bring an end to the sorcerer-kings' villainy.
	As you embark on this destiny, your actions win you renown throughout the land. Wherever you go, people come to glimpse you. Throughout Athas, people whisper about your power and your intentions. Cities and merchant houses send envoys, bringing you tribute and seeking your favor. Raiders, refugees, escaped slaves, and fugitives flock to you. Some come to learn from you, and others come to fight on your behalf. Between your adventures, a mighty entourage surrounds you. Yet despite your acclaim, you are quick to strike out on your own or with a few trusted companions when adventure calls. Only cowards would have others fight on their behalf.

The ancient, long-lived pyreens embody all life on Athas. In their features are the traits of every race. Many of them share ancestry with the primal spirits. From your early years, you felt a kinship with these rare and elusive creatures. As time went on, and your primal power grew, you became one of them.
	As a powerful primal protector, you guard a vast region of land. The Forest Ridge or the Estuary of the Forked Tongue might be under your personal protection. The spirits of the land listen to your counsel and regard you as one of them. They exalt you, because you have the ability to restore the world to verdant glory.
	As a pyreen, you can never die from old age. This quality gives you a perspective others lack: The things worth fighting for in the world are those that last. Though you might assist people in fixing what you regard as trivial plights, you rarely put your life in jeopardy for their sakes. You know that a much greater destiny awaits you.

Upon completion of your final quest, you disappear, leaving only dust, as you are entirely absorbed by your deity. You become part of it, aware of what happens in the world around you, but unable to participate while your deity is still dead.
	Perhaps your sacrifice rejuvenates the dead deity, or it might increase the activity of the deity's cult, giving it a chance at resurrection in the future.

When you follow this destiny, you begin to transform into an avatar of your dead deity, but at a price. As you leech power from your deity, your soul slowly dwindles and rekindles glimmers of the deity's consciousness. You gain considerable power and mental resilience but sacrifice some of your life force to earn that power.
	As this connection grows stronger, you also become more attuned to the lingering echoes of your deity's feelings and thoughts. You come as close to being one entity as is possible, and this brings the realization that you must surrender your individuality to ever bring your power to the next level and achieve the return of your deity—or, if you prefer, your transformation into a deity.

Your spirit is accustomed to plumbing the depths of the Astral Sea, and it returns there when death beckons. With its last flicker, your spirit can gather the dissipating essence of your dead deity and fuse it into the spark of life. While this process appears to take only moments to your friends, to you it feels as if you were adrift for days or weeks. When you make death saving throws during an encounter, any successful saving throw has the same effect as if you had rolled a 20. If you have no healing surges, you regain hit points equal to your healing surge value. Once this feature is used, it can't be used again until after you have taken an extended rest.

Your ceaseless drive to learn and your devotion to Ioun has enabled you to attain a status few others can claim. As a Sage of the Swan Tower, you have gained access to the glorious Halls of Enlightenment and can call upon its infinite knowledge. You, however, are not like the other sages. You find the traditional method of learning through reading to be insufficient and spend much of your time in the field, acquiring new knowledge and testing theories.
    Each new nugget of information—each new revelation—brings you closer to the goal that you have held in your heart for so long. You feel the call of Ioun as you achieve greater feats of discovery and demystify new layers of knowledge. Eventually your dream becomes reality, and you are invited to become one of the timeless sages of the Swan Tower.
    Life among your fellow sages in Kerith-Ald is all you hoped it would be, yet you see more potential for yourself every time you visit the Pillars of Ioun. It has been a long time since Ioun has honored one of her sages in such a way. Perhaps with some perseverance you can come to deserve your own alabaster monument.

As a Guardian of the Void, your destiny is tied to those who hope to unlock the power of the Echoing Void. Perhaps you crossed paths early, fighting a minor skirmish that later proved to be one of the first steps in beginning the ritual. A guardian has little knowledge of this destiny, assuming its mantle only when the ritual nears its final stages. You might find that a few disparate events come together to paint a terrifying pattern—one that you must disrupt.
	A Guardian of the Void fights to prevent the Echoing Void's completion, to destroy all knowledge of the ritual, and to defeat those who would pursue the power it offers. By the time a guardian arises, the threat posed to the cosmos is both dire and imminent. You will face down the servants of the powerful creature that seeks to complete the Echoing Void, preparing for your final battle. </specific>

The Shadowfell is a realm of death, the one thing in the universe that unifies all mortal folk, from the lowliest beggar to the mightiest emperor. Even the gods are vulnerable to death's sting. During the Dawn War between the gods and the primordials, many deities fell in battle. Since that time, gods have died at the hands of demons and even mortals.
	Some creatures seek to escape death's grasp. A wizard walks the dark path of lichdom to attain immortality. An alchemist brews a secret elixir that will extend his life by centuries. Such creatures only delay the inevitable. Others, however, take a more direct approach to avoiding their fate.
	Scattered pieces of lore, some dating back to the time before the Dawn War, suggest that death is not an intrinsic part of the cosmic order. By performing a dark ritual known as the Echoing Void, creatures intent on immortality at any cost can overcome death—but only by sacrificing millions of sentient lives.
	The signs of preparation for this ritual are unmistakable. For a creature that seeks to create devastation on such a massive scale, the options are few—perhaps smashing an astral dominion or annihilating an entire region of the world. Secrecy rather than overwhelming power is such a villain's primary tool, since the pursuit of the Echoing Void is bound to draw the wrath of heroes, gods, fiends, and primordials alike.
	When the ritual of the Echoing Void is begun, the magic it gathers spawns an equal and opposite reaction. The cosmos anoints champions to oppose the ritual's master. These powerful heroes become the Guardians of the Void, dedicated to preventing the wholesale destruction of the established order of death and life.

A constant stream of spirits passes through the Shadowfell—part of a grand procession of life, death, and rebirth known to a few ascetics as the everflow. Those who believe in the everflow also believe that it was once intended to return souls back to the world for a new lease on life. According to legend, the dread god Nerull usurped the everflow by hoarding the spirits of the dead. His successor, the Raven Queen, only partly undid the damage done by the fallen god, cutting the everflow short and passing judgment on mortal souls as she sees fit.
	The select few who have glimpsed this truth have chosen to correct the course of the everflow. To do this, the Keepers of the Everflow must find a mighty construct hidden deep in the darklands of the Shadowfell—the great Spirit Wheel, set in motion by the actions of the first Keepers. If they complete their work, the everflow will trickle away from the Raven Queen's domain as the procession of souls is redirected from the road to Letherna back into the world. The existence of the Keepers of the Everflow is an affront to the god of death, and she will stop at nothing until the faithful of this upstart order are all held in her wintry grasp.

Letherna lies deep in the Shadowfell, far beyond the reach of most mortals. This bastion of the Raven Queen is seen only by the spirits of the dead and by the privileged retainers and bodyguards of the god of death. Those loyal to the Raven Queen stand ready to defend her citadel's frost-covered walls from any threat.
	Ages ago, when the Raven Queen struck down the dread god Nerull, the other deities crafted a pact that changed the nature of the gods' relationship with death. To prevent the recently ascended queen from hoarding the spirits of the dead as her own personal army, the pact stipulated that the Raven Queen would be the god of death but not god of the dead, serving as a custodian of the natural cycle of life and death. In return, the gods would allow the Raven Queen to enlist their own followers to aid her worshipers in the defense of her realm. This arrangement suited the Raven Queen, herself an ascended mortal, who preferred to deal with mortals more than with the uncaring powers of the Astral Sea.
	That call of duty has sounded again. The armies of Letherna have need of commanders, and only the greatest heroes can be entrusted with the sanctity of the afterlife. With grim determination, the Marshals of Letherna pick up the Raven Queen's banner and stand fast in the defense of her bastion.

During your time as a Twilight Tribune, you might begin hearing whispers of an unspeakable evil lumbering its way back into existence. Could a slain god rise as an undead? Could Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath, animate the corpse of dread Nerull as his servant, thus gaining enough power to challenge the gods directly?
	At the end of your journey, you might pass into the afterlife as all mortals do, or you might volunteer to stay behind as a ghostly judge—your unmatched wisdom continuing to guide mortal souls into the beyond. You might serve the Raven Queen as an advisor, or you might lead a covenant of tribunes that eventually replace her as the gods of fate and death. </specific>

All mortals have a dark road ahead of them in the afterlife. When their spirits are released from the flesh they were born into, they venture into the Shadowfell to make their way to the cold slopes of Letherna—and to whatever final destination awaits beyond the halls of the Raven Queen. However, some souls linger in the mortal realm, unable or unwilling to take this fateful journey. Entities such as ghosts, specters, wraiths, and devourers are the most dangerous of these hesitant spirits, committing atrocities through malicious intent or mindless despair.
	In response to this scourge, the greatest and wisest heroes of the world are called by fate and the Raven Queen to serve as the Twilight Tribunes. These selfless champions dedicate their lives to seeking out and destroying wayward incorporeal souls. By invoking their dread judgment, the Twilight Tribunes allow even the most tormented undead to leave their lives and pain behind. As they follow the path of their destiny, the Twilight Tribunes are drawn to ever more powerful creatures and challenges, working their way through the most fearsome creatures of shadow and undeath. Having dispensed with liches, dracoliches, and vampires, a tribune might be called on in the end to face off against beings of godlike power and the greatest lords of the undead.

You might face assassins, powerful fey, or even armies that wish to put an end to your ascension, but those conflicts are the bedrock for the stories to come that extol your greatness.

Few heroes have borne the name Witch Queen (or Witch King), but those few have inspired awe, fear, and dread.
	These beings become living legends, the stock character in the myths, fairy tales, and horror stories of every race, as awe-inspiring as they are terrifying. Those who have accepted this mantle have learned to incorporate their power into their being, no longer treating it as a source separate from their form.
	Before becoming a Witch Queen, those who aspired to fill the role were conflicted between three aspects: one's power, one's familiar, and one's self. But when one becomes a king or queen of all witches, these aspects merge, allowing a Witch Queen or Witch King to bring forth spells as easily as if his or her familiar had whispered the arcane words directly into their ear. These individuals are near equals to their patrons in power, and armies clamor to their banners, while mortals and immortals alike seek their counsel to beg their favor or plead for their mercy.

Deep in the Feywild, far from the stately halls of the eladrin, a tradition has been upheld for eons. In shadowy forests thick with moss and undergrowth, the baying of hunting hounds sounds, followed by the long strides of their masters. As storm clouds cover the sky, the forest is no longer a realm of bedtime stories or folk tales. It becomes the province of the Wild Hunt.
	The tradition of the Wild Hunt originated among the firbolgs, fey giants devoted to the moon and the Three Fates, personified by Sehanine (the Maiden), Melora (the Mother), and the Raven Queen (the Crone). The firbolgs call for a Wild Hunt when they seek to punish an oath breaker, for oaths are powerful things in the Feywild. Some mortals, their trust betrayed by the Unseelie fey, have learned to summon these eldritch hunters to bring down those who wronged them. A select few learn the ritual for summoning the hunters, but instead of asking for justice, request to learn the secrets of the Wild Hunt. Such requests are rarely accepted, but a worthy few learn the ways of the Wild Hunt, bringing retribution to all traitors and oath breakers.

Myriad archfey band together several times a year at the congress known as the Court of Stars, where they engage in diplomacy, schemes, marriages, betrayals, and legendary revels. Although dozens of lesser factions make up the Court of Stars, they mostly acknowledge the leadership of Her Summer Majesty, Queen Tiandra. And the Queen of Summer, when the need arises, turns to her anointed warriors for the defense of her subjects and allies. These warriors are known as Shiradi Champions, the shields of the fey.
	Whereas eladrin nobles might rise through the ranks of coures, bralanis, ghaeles, and other complex titles, Shiradi Champions are usually individuals who have earned the respect and trust of Queen Tiandra. Archfey of all courts assemble at Senaliesse to bear witness to a champion's anointing. Some eye these protectors with suspicion, arrogance, or envy, but their pettiness is ill placed. Each Shiradi Champion is devoted to the lovely Queen of Summer and determined to justify her trust.
	Some eladrin Shiradi Champions are also shiere knights (see Player's Handbook 2). A very few champions are not born as one of the fey, and their ascendancy to the role of Shiradi Champion is an unprecedented event, a testament to the champion's unique valor and great worth. Whatever path a champion takes, he or she is assuredly an ally and protector of good-natured fey beings everywhere.

You have walked through the darkest shadows to achieve your destiny. You have sacrificed companions, betrayed allies, and performed acts so despicable they are legendary. You are beyond temptation. You have passed through the veil of corruption and unmasked true evil. You bask in the awful glory of true wickedness.
	It no longer matters why you descended into darkness. The past is trivial. What matters now is that you secure your place in the cosmos or destroy it in the process. Your destiny is to become one of the world's greatest antiheroes, to carve your name in the annals of history through blood and death. The objective you seek is what you were born to do, the act you were made to perform. You have come this far; you will not allow anything to stop you.

Long ago, an ancient race of mighty sorcerers abandoned the material world for the Elemental Chaos, drawn by the plane's infinite mutability. These were the Reigar, a humanlike people who revered personal freedom, expression, and artistry above all other values. In time they mastered the secrets of immortality and became a race of godlings in mortal form-self-centered, capricious, driven only by the desire to experience new sensations and outdo each other in creative works. Foreseeing that their race would eventually dwindle and stagnate, the Reigar created one last masterwork of cooperative magic: a sentient, self-guiding force that would seek out the most brilliant and worthy souls among mortals and gift them with the powers of the Reigar, thus renewing the race across the ages.
	In the course of your mortal adventures, you have developed into that one person in a million who embodies the exquisitely rare mix of brilliance, beauty, willfulness, and creativity that characterizes the immortal ranks of the Reigar. The ancient lore of the Reigar has revealed itself to you and given you the ability to shape the world to suit your whims.

Arcane Swords all hunger to improve their skill, but even these perfectionists one day recognize when they have reached the height of their art. Different Arcane Swords follow different routes to immortality; one of these might be your path.
Martial Seclusion: When you complete your final quest, you sequester yourself in a place where few are likely to find you. Here you create your own private sanctum, a place of peace where you can train day and night, eventually becoming one with your blade and your magic.
Dojo Master: When you complete your final quest, you might decide to teach others something of what you have learned. Instead of a private sanctum, you create a school where you teach the best swordmages of a generation the secrets of your craft.
Relic Sword: A few stories relate how some Arcane Swords meld into and become one and the same as their sword, creating a named artifact that persists in the world through all its future ages. </specific>

Barriers of shimmering arcane incantations sheathe your body, deflecting and dissipating your enemies&apos; attacks.

Eldritch power reverberates between you and your sword, creating an arcane conduit that promises nothing but destruction for any who stand in your way. You are a sword mage, and your goal is nothing less than perfection.
You have become the utmost practitioner of your art; it has been long since you&apos;ve sought others to teach you their secrets. You have become your own teacher, and your ceaseless study into the dual arts of blade and magic has yielded a bounty of techniques that combine martial skill with magical prowess.
Others believe that you apply your incredible and growing skill to achieve ends important to you. That is true, to a point. In fact, you take up epic quests and engage terrible foes in order to improve your art. Your ambition transcends other concerns, but also uses them as a foil. You might save the world, but in doing so, you seek to become the ultimate swordmage, an Arcane Sword.

As the final syllable leaves your lips, the casting infuses every fiber of your being. You and your spell become one and the same. As long as anyone else knows your spell, you persist in that caster&apos;s living mind and in the dusty texts of old tomes, encoded in the spell&apos;s formula.

In your expert opinion, of all the varied spells that have passed the lips of casters down the ages, there is one whose elegance, power, and conceptual fundamental beauty surpasses all others. You should know, because you have endured much to master it. You refer to this spell of spells (with some pride) as your “signature spell.”
Other arcane characters might cast the same spell, but your study of it, with an attention to detail none could ever hope to match, has unlocked intricacies of the power that have been lost on all others. Of course, it would be impossible to research every spell in your arsenal with such exacting care. There is not time enough in any one life for such a project. That&apos;s why you have chosen just one spell to devote yourself to entirely. A single spell, one which no other creature will ever cast as magnificently as you cast it.
Sometimes you take pity on others you happen to encounter that also cast your signature spell. You might approach these unenlightened mages and offer them encouragement, and explain to them that one day they might be great, but only if they improve their technique with the spell in question. If they show interest, you are more than happy to demonstrate your skill with your spell.
As you progress in power and mastery, your reputation as a connoisseur of your signature spell also grows. In fact, your name begins to become synonymous with the spell. You can hardly imagine anything more satisfying: With every casting, your name, too, is spoken aloud.

You care little about the fate of your mortal shell, for you know that in time you will rejoin with your true self. After all, even gods must die in time.

You are the mortal incarnation of a deity who holds sway over death. You are not simply Jozan the cleric; you are the Raven Queen, who for a time incarnates in the form of Jozan. Your body is a mere shell, a temporary vessel for the unthinkable might of a deity&apos;s soul. You were born to be the Raven Queen&apos;s mortal form, and as you grow in understanding and power, the light (or darkness) within you shines out for all to see. You might not have realized your true nature before, but now you know exactly what you are.

As an avatar of death, you incarnate the death aspect of your deity. Most likely this is the Raven Queen, but on rare occasions avatars of dead, dormant, or interloper gods arise—you might be an avatar of the dead god Nerull, or some other death deity contesting the Raven Queen&apos;s sway.

Good and evil are just words to you, for death makes all causes meaningless. You stare into the vacant sockets of long-dead kings, gaze across the soul-filled plains of the Shadowfell, and stand upon blood-soaked fields of battle. Through it all, you feel no sorrow, no remorse—only a grim sense of bemusement at mortal foolishness in the face of the inevitable. Adventuring is an amusing way to entertain yourself before life comes to an end.

You fight any force that seeks the enslavement of others and stand against deities bent on war and domination, such as Asmodeus and Bane. You believe that freedom of choice is the paramount freedom of all mortal creatures, and that destiny is not predetermined. You inspire the downtrodden with words of freedom, and you lead them in attempts to overthrow their vile masters.

You hold particular vehemence toward devils and demons—devils for their malicious practices, and demons for their recklessly destructive intentions.

Your path might involve the elimination of a major source of injustice, such as an evil deity. The evil gods and their worshipers scoff at justice, reveling in cruelty, theft, and murder. Destroying one of these deities brings the scales of justice closer to balance.
Divine Reunion: During your Destiny Quest, you begin to change. You no longer make decisions—you merely do the will of justice. When your final foe is vanquished, you abandon your mortal body, which falls to silvery dust and blows away in the wind.  Yoursoul finds its way back to your eternal being and reunites, bringing with it all the joys, the sorrows, the wisdom, and the compassion you have learned in your mortal years. Your mortal existence might be done—but as a god of justice you well remember the lessons you learned during your time in the world, and temper your judgments with memories of your mortal experience. </specific>

You are a god of justice incarnated in mortal form. All your life you have fought for justice, but now you know yourself for what you are. Your self-awareness merges with divine truth, and your consciousness becomes one with the concept of justice. In years to come, people will remember that you were your deity in the flesh, a shining champion who battled against wrong and a golden example of a righteous and courageous life well lived, but for now it is up to you to forge that legend.

In your true self you might be Bahamut, some other active deity, or even a dead deity such as Amoth—avatars of dormant deities, interloper gods, or cosmic principles sometimes appear in the world. Regardless of which deity you are the incarnation of, you grasp your destiny as a great lawgiver and a force for righteousness. As you take the guise of justice itself, divine knowledge guides you along the right course.

As an avatar of life, you might be blessed with incredible longevity. Your calling could draw you to retire to a monastery or a temple to live in obscurity, protecting a small community from harm. You might be fated to heal some great sickness in the world, battling a magical plague or putting an end to some corruption or mockery of life that threatens the natural order. Or you might be compelled to venture across the planes, bringing an example of hope and healing wherever you go.
Divine Reunion: After you have completed your Destiny Quest and lived out the years appointed to you, you are called back to your true self. Lying down in a fair green meadow or forest clearing, you allow your body to crumble into dust, nourishing flowering vines and creepers. Your soul returns to your divine self, recalling the awesome power and understanding that comes with godhood. But some part of your mortal being still survives, since your memories, your cares, and your journeys are now your deity&apos;s too. </specific>

You are the incarnation of a god, mortal and immortal beings united in the same flesh. You exist for the purpose of battling your true godly self &apos;s foes in the mortal world, of providing inspiration and hope to all who worship your divine being, and just possibly to learn a few things about what it means to walk in the world you helped to shape at the dawn of time. At the same time, you are also the mortal persona you have been throughout your current life, and you are destined to become part of the god you have served so well.

Avatars represent many different aspects of the gods, but you specifically embody the vital principle, the animating spirit of your deity. All life is sacred to you, and you are its divine protector. Your time as an adventurer has taught you how precarious life can be, whether it is the life of a butterfly struggling to escape its cocoon or a civilization living on the edge of lands inhabited by orcs and goblins. You hate taking life, but you recognize that it is the nature of the world that you must sometimes kill or be killed.

Longevity is rarely important to an avatar of storm. You recognize that life and civilization are fleeting things in this world, and that enough wind and rain can wash away the existence of anything.

You might even challenge the Elemental Chaos, battling primordials for dominion over storms.
Divine Reunion: When you accomplish your final quest, your mortal existence comes to an end and you return to your divine form. Your body vanishes in a blinding thunderstroke, leaping upward into the dark storm clouds that gather overhead. Your ascension is marked by a thunderstorm of spectacular power. While your mortal life is at an end, your memories, your passions, and your struggles are all now part of your divine being. </specific>

You are two beings at the same time: a great mortal hero and the god of storms. You have always known you were different from the people around you, but now you understand what you are and why your heart sings when lightning flashes and thunder rolls in the distance. You are destined to walk the world in mortal form for a single brief lifetime, an inspiration to those who worship your true self and a terrible foe to those who oppose you. And after your incarnation ends and you reunite with your immortal being, people will look back on your deeds for centuries to come and see in them the hand of the divine.

As an avatar of storm, you are most likely an incarnation of Kord. However, minor storm deities or dormant powers sometimes incarnate as avatars, so you might be the mortal vessel of some other deity, or even a cosmic principle of storms and destruction.

Thunder and lightning are your weapons, and you wield them with all the fury and wrath of the most violent storm. Wherever you go, storms follow in your wake. You command them and use their power to bring your vengeance upon your enemies.

The route to immortality is fraught with danger for an avatar of war. Due to a thirst for conflict, an avatar of war engages in many mortal contests. History tells the tale of several avatars of war cut down in epic battles—it could be that your fate is to forge a legend of a hero who only succeeded in dying well. The ultimate challenge lies in giving battle to the gods and primordials. Whether you hope to usurp power from Bane and conquer his home plane of Chernoggar or to rain destruction down upon surviving primordials, you carry in your ambition a war the likes of which hasn&apos;t been seen in a thousand years.
Divine Reunion: When your final quest is accomplished and your last foe lies vanquished at your feet, your mortal incarnation ends. Your body falls into gray dust and blows away to the sounds of ravens croaking and tattered banners flapping in the cold wind. Your soul ascends to the astral dominions to rejoin your divine being, bringing with it a lifetime of memories: battles won, battles lost, deeds of courage, acts of cowardice. </specific>

Battle calls you, for you are the god of war. For a mortal lifetime you are incarnated in humanoid shape, sharing the existence and consciousness of a mortal hero. When you speak, you speak for your true divine self. When you act, you act as your godly essence directs. You exist to champion causes worth fighting for, to provide the people of the world with a shining example of valor and skill, and to teach people how to survive in a world filled with darkness and strife.

As an avatar of war, you are probably the incarnation of Bahamut, Kord, Bane, or possibly a dead war deity such as Tuern. However, war is a cosmic force that seems to have its own guiding consciousness, and you might in fact be the incarnation of the principle of war, or an eternal hero reborn to fight in every conflict spawned upon the mortal world.

Life as an adventurer has opened your eyes to the fact that strife and evil are ubiquitous. You have journeyed through many lands, both civilized and wild, and the only constant is the fragility of peace. Others work hard to stop war, but you believe it is the natural state of the world. You recognize that conflict is everywhere, and you embrace it. The machinations of usurpers, tyrants, and warlords will always drive civilization toward violence and destruction— but sometimes it is exactly this destructive force that gives rise to the most powerful and enduring of civilizations.

Once per day, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you regain all of your hit points and transform into a Large platinum dragon. While in this form, you gain darkvision, resist 20 cold, resist 20 fire, fly 10 (hover), dragon bite, and breath weapon (see below for these powers). In addition, each enemy within 5 squares of you takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls while you remain in this form.
Beyond those changes, becoming a dragon doesn&apos;t change your game statistics. Your equipment becomes part of your dragon form, but you drop anything you are holding, except implements you can use. You continue to gain the benefits of the equipment you wear. You can use the properties and the powers of implements as well as magic items that you wear, but not the properties or the powers of weapons or the powers of wondrous items. While equipment is part of your dragon form, it cannot be removed, and anything in a container that is part of your dragon form is inaccessible. 
This effect lasts until the end of the encounter or until you use breath weapon, at which point you resume your normal form.

Ever since you were young, you&apos;ve had an instinctive sense that you were special. As you grew older and saw more of the world, you learned of the Draconic Prophecy, and you began to recognize that you have some part to play in it. You realized that the reason you felt special was because of your connection to the Prophecy.
You&apos;ve discovered tangible, concrete indications of your role in the Prophecy. Your understanding of the Prophecy might be subtle (a whisper in your head that imparts prophetic guidance at key junctures in your life), or it might be overt (a reference to you in ancient texts that concern the Prophecy). Perhaps dragons pay you a visit to tell you of your role in the Prophecy.
Regardless of the way in which you learned of your destiny, you have embraced it. Your training has prepared you for the challenges you face, and woe betide anyone who stands in your way. You are an agent of fate, a representative of prophecy, and one can no sooner hold you back than stop time from passing.

To the mortals who worship them, the gods are the highest form of life. Possessed of incalculable strength and wisdom, the deities hold the power to create new races and raze whole continents at their whim. Yet for all their magnificence, the gods are flawed beings, possessed of the same failures of judgment and character that plague the mortals living beneath their gaze.
	You are not the first to look beyond godhood, bearing witness to an infinite perfection that supersedes even the deities&apos; power. At the height of creation lies a cause or a purpose whose intent remains inscrutable even to the gods. Some might seek to pay homage to this being beyond beings—this idea and first cause, the Demiurge responsible for the sum of all things. You, however, have no intention of joining with or serving this force. Rather, you hope to secure its power for yourself. You will shape reality as you see fit, rebuilding the cosmos in your own image and from your own imagination.

You live half in the present, and half in the future as a disincarnated spirit. As the present catches up to the future, you draw closer to the fate that you have forged.

Destined Rebirth: In the days, weeks, and months leading up to the completion of your Destiny Quest, you wield powers that are supposed to be possessed only by devas in their spiritual state. As you do so, you steer yourself toward your own eventual rebirth, either by using those powers for good deeds, or for wicked.

When you have at last achieved that which you were destined to do, you know that you can finally shed your current form and move on to the afterlife you have forged. As all devas do, you relieve your spirit of your body, but unlike other devas you spend no time in a state of bodiless dreaming between lives. Each time you die, you are reborn instantly in the form that you chose (either as a deva, or as a rakshasa), full of the knowledge that you gained during your last life. Each time you die, the wheel of fate spins you out into the world, in a form chosen by you, and with the ability to wield the powers that bestow the miraculous reincarnation upon your race. </specific>

Death holds few mysteries for the devas, who know—for a fact—that a new life waits for them beyond death. However, uncertainty comes in the form of the question of whether the deva is reborn as a deva, or as a rakshasa, depending on the wickedness of the deva&apos;s life. Many devas believe that being affected by curses or dying particularly vile deaths can corrupt their souls, transforming the most benevolent deva into a rakshasa in his or her next life.

You, however, have broken through the barriers of knowledge to peer into the future of your disincarnation, the time when you become a bodiless entity drifting through the spirit realm. You know that death is soon to be upon you, but not before you have attained your destiny. You have already mastered the power bestowed upon your soul as a disincarnate, and you can wield those powers while you yet live. For you, disincarnation holds no uncertainty, because you know that you can forge your next life with your actions in this one.

Having already tapped into the same mystical power that bestows constant rebirth upon your soul, you can call upon abilities granted only to disincarnated deva spirits and rakshasas, becoming more than who you are and, instead, becoming a manifestation of who you might yet be. You have reached into the mystical afterlife waiting for all devas and drawn back a fragment of the power that makes such miracles possible. You see not just your own future, but many possible futures, and you can alter the winds of fortune to guarantee the reincarnation you seek.

Long ago, far back in the mists of time, ancient dragons mastered the power of arcane magic and used it to shape the world around them. In those dark first days, the world was a primeval place, and these dragons held dominion over everything they beheld. The races thought of as ancient today, such as dwarves and elves, were but children when these spellcasting dragons were at the height of their power. The fabric of reality was reshaped by these dragons, who used their arcane prowess to warp the world around them.
	Those days of limitless power could not last, and soon the mighty dragon sorcerers fell. Being jealous guardians of their arcane lore, few passed on what they had learned to the other dragons. Over time, as these dragons fell into obscurity and legend, the knowledge of their spells and magic likewise vanished from the world. Now, millennia later, archmages and sages occasionally unearth fragments of lore pertaining to these great wyrms and perhaps master a spell or two from the dragons&apos; repertoire. Even the most powerful wizard, however, would be but a stage magician compared to the ancient spellcasting dragons.
	Now the winds of fate circle around once more, and the spirits of those long-dead dragons find themselves spun back into the world, this time in the bodies of smaller, mortal creatures. Although others might feel the call of arcane magic from the depths of their soul, you hear the whispers of the ancient dragon spirit within you. It coaxes you, guides you, and teaches you. Yours is not a quiet soul but a raging inferno of arcane knowledge waiting to be released. Your dragon soul awakens and remembers what it was like to be a master of all it saw.

By the favor of the gods, you transcend mortality and join the angelic hosts. Your mortal flesh and blood are transformed into immortal substance; even though you still have your mortal appearance, your spirit shines inside your perfected body like a blazing fire in a crystal vessel. As an angel, you no longer age, and all the infirmities of mortality fall away. In time you learn to assume more and more of the appearance and powers of angels.

You are closely bound to the god who raised you up. You can continue to pursue the quests and goals of your mortal life, but from time to time your deity summons you to specific missions or dispatches you on important errands, and you are expected to answer any such call. Because you were once mortal, you can resume your mortal appearance whenever you wish, hiding your immortal nature. This attribute makes you a valuable servant, since you can go where other angels cannot; exalted angels often serve as spies or advise mortals on important matters without ever revealing their true nature.

Your mastery over the mystical arts that twine through the Feywild has earned you the respect of eladrin and other noble fey creatures. You are seen as a great leader in the sometimes fanciful, wondrous echo of the world. Where castles of eladrin nobles raise their gleaming spires, your name has been bandied about as a potential lord of great power. Where shadowed hillocks cover twilight tunnels into the brooding Feydark, your name is also whispered, but as a curse.
As a lord of the Feywild, you are sometimes called upon to use your power to defend the interests of the faerie realm. However, your interests are wider still, and you often use your knowledge and ties to aid you in your own quests and errands. Sometimes, a future version of yourself steps back through the world lines to offer aid, and in so doing provide a glimpse of what one day might be in a fey echo of reality.

Your eternal fate depends on the state of the world when you die.
Fury Made Placid: If your death stops the destruction of nature, you can sleep in peace. By defeating a great enemy of the natural world, or creating a great expanse of untouched wilderness, you can overcome the rage that drives you. You become one of the great spirits, but one that is peaceful. The speakers of primal lore will tell tales of your change and how your great sacrifice prevented nature&apos;s decline, thus quelling your anger. You now live as a more benevolent spirit of peace or beauty.
The Fury Eternal: Despite all your effort and all your rage, nature is subjected to more transgressions every day. You can no longer contain your outrage, and you permanently become a spirit of fury. You stalk the wilderness and rampage into cities indiscriminately, wreaking agony and destruction on all in your path. Your story is a cautionary one.

As you performed ever greater deeds throughout the cosmos, uniting the scattered humans of the world into a new empire greater even than Nerath, more and more have called you lord-even savior. And as those who look to you for leadership multiply, the whispers begin that you are more than human. Not only are you set apart from mortals, but your destiny is to ascend even further, beyond the petty concerns of the material world. This ascension will mark not only your own greatness, but also that of the civilization you champion.
	At first you remain a physical presence in the capital of your realm, guiding your governors and generals with a firm hand, but over time your laws and commandments take on their own life. The leaders of your society increasingly divine your will from this body of knowledge rather than hearing it from your lips, while your focus gradually moves to the planes-spanning affairs of gods and demigods. Eventually, you fade from the world and join their ranks, a great patron invoked in ceremonies and on holy days, to whom the greatest achievements of your civilization are dedicated.

You have lived many lives, each improving on the one before. In this last life, you have come closer than ever to achieving perfect harmony. If you can succeed in purging yourself of the last traces of imperfection, you will know enlightenment.

In attaining this state, you are no longer troubled by the world&apos;s demands, and you spend your final days in quiet contemplation. During those days, many who seek the path to enlightenment will come to you in hopes of learning from your wisdom.

It is said that not even the gods themselves know what lies in store for souls loosed from their bodies. You believe that beyond death is rebirth. Each lifetime is spent improving on the lifetime before, shedding imperfections in the hope of attaining the perfect state of enlightenment.
	Your soul is like a great garden, and its beauty and perfection depend on how you tend it during all seasons. When the winter of death approaches, the garden becomes dormant for a time. Then, as the warm winds chase away snow and ice, new life begins. With the spring comes the chance to clear away the detritus and weeds of each life that has passed before. Only when you achieve perfection in your soul will you find the enlightenment that is your ultimate reward.

      <specific name="Immortality"> Immortality
Your destiny is written in the Prophecy, and it is greater than the short span of your mortal life. As the Prophecy writes itself on your skin, you gain an increasing depth of understanding into its meaning and the various ways it can be fulfilled. What&apos;s more, you begin to understand that while you are a player in a cosmic drama, you are also the playwright, master of your own destiny, and not bound to any single vision of the future, whatever the Prophecy might say.
	The Eternal Prophecy: When you complete whatever the Prophecy has in store for you—or whatever destiny you wrote into the Prophecy for yourself—you might disappear from the world for a time. But just as prophetic marks appear written on the bones of the earth, your Siberys mark is a part of the world. The Prophecy is Eberron, Eberron is the Prophecy, and you are equally part of both. If the world needs you in the future, you might choose to manifest once more in flesh forever altered by the mark of the Prophecy on your skin. </specific>

Most dragonmarked individuals manifest their marks in adolescence, when heirs of the dragonmarked houses undergo a rite called the Test of Siberys. This test puts the young heirs into stressful situations in the hopes that their marks will manifest. Siberys dragonmarks, however, break all the rules.
	The magic of a Siberys dragonmark is powerful and fundamentally unpredictable. The mark is larger and more elaborate than the normal mark in its family, but it&apos;s rare for a normal mark to develop into a Siberys mark—more often, Siberys marks appear on older members of the house who were previously unmarked. Even more so than the common dragonmarks, a Siberys mark is viewed as the touch of the Prophecy—a character&apos;s inextricable link to the destiny of the world.
	The dragonmarked houses keep a careful eye on members who bear Siberys marks. If a Siberys mark can be used in the service of the house, the house&apos;s leaders are content to let it, but a Siberys heir who does not remain firmly under the house&apos;s control is likely to become the target of assassins.
	In game terms, a character can adopt the Heir of Siberys epic destiny to reflect the presence of this exceptional mark. Most characters with Siberys dragonmarks did not previously have a dragonmark, but a character who already has a dragonmarked feat isn&apos;t prevented from taking this paragon path.
	This is a generic destiny that any Heir of Siberys can choose, though the utility power the destiny bestows at 26th level depends on the character&apos;s specific Siberys dragonmark. You can also craft unique epic destinies for each Siberys mark or even for each individual with such a mark. Heirs of Siberys, by their nature, defy easy categorization and have little in common with each other or with other dragonmarked characters.

Your legacy will be the reformation of the image of Bael Turath. Once more the world shall see a golden age wherein the light of civilization pushes back the darkness of lawlessness and strife. Your name and deeds will echo throughout history because the empire you form will itself be immortal.
	By Destiny Crowned: When you complete your final quest, you have earned a reputation for great goodness. Your deeds are the stuff of legend, even when compared to your companions. Human kings and queens kneel in the court you create, and the royalties of other peoples come there to bow in homage. Even the dead stones of ruins of Bael Turath recognize your greatness. By your presence alone they rise from the earth and remake themselves in brighter forms. You too are remade, for when you accepted the mantle of leadership, you became a true leader. Gone were the sins and foibles of the past, replaced by noble righteousness. Others follow your example, and soon those who see a tiefling expect not wickedness but honor.
	Alternatively, you build your empire upon the bones of those who defy you. Many seek to thwart your rule, and thus many die by your hands or those of your fanatical followers. It&apos;s not the way you wanted it to happen, but you know the ends justify the means. They will remember you as a terrible tyrant, but your story will be passed down through the generations of a great society that continues to exist for millennia after your bones have turned to dust. </specific>

	Yet that right comes with the responsibility to protect and steward, rather than abuse and enslave. You realize that your ancestors squandered the gift of their destiny, and you vow not to do the same.
	You struggle with this fate. Why you and why now? How can an empire so evil deserve rebirth? Yet the pieces of the tiefling past that pass into your life come alive at your touch. The crown fits. The scepter&apos;s weight feels right in your hands. The throne feels like home. You dare to think that you might guide the world to see the bright future that you experience in prophetic dreams.
	Your new Bael Turath shall not be a place of shadows and despair. All who seek safety and peace will find refuge. Justice will be merciful. Your rule will be righteous. Tieflings will again have a home in the world. The curse that devils laid upon mankind will become a blessing.
	An empire cannot rise overnight, yet many already look to you for leadership. More flock to your banner every day. Your fame surpasses that of any tiefling who has lived since the empire&apos;s fall. If the empire can be returned to glory, it will be at your hand.

As you have risen toward epic power, it has become increasingly clear that you have a unique relationship with the ancestor spirits that other primal heroes know as guides and allies. If you&apos;re a druid, you hear the voices of the ancestors each time you shift shapes. If you&apos;re a barbarian, your rages are always tempered by a third perspective, and sometimes a fourth, fifth, and sixth, as if you were observing yourself from above and on each side, seeing through more than your own rage-filled eyes. If you&apos;re a warden, you understand that the tribe&apos;s ancient protectors are your peers, not just your ancestors. If you&apos;re a shaman, you have realized the truth before attaining your epic destiny: The ancestors are more than guides and allies—they were once your comrades, your friends, and your helpers when you walked the world in earlier lifetimes, helping the people as an ancestor spirit.

You are an ancient ancestor reborn into a new life. You share understandings and communication with other primal spirits beyond anything that most primal heroes experience because you know all the voices of the spirits, all the subtle ways and swift whispers by which they make themselves known. You can see the spirits everywhere in the world as they inhabit trees and rocks or flow through the bodies of you and your allies.

You reject civilization and the temptations of the cities. You see the city-states groan beneath the sorcerer-kings' tyrannies, and you observe how the people fear to speak out. The city dwellers, even non-slaves, give up freedom and morality for the promise of wealth and protection, but you do not make that choice. You have turned to the wilds to be your haven, abandoning "civilized" folk to the fate they deserve. You hone your body and master your techniques until the day comes when you will be powerful enough to tear down the city walls and bring an end to the sorcerer-kings' villainy.
	As you embark on this destiny, your actions win you renown throughout the land. Wherever you go, people come to glimpse you. Throughout Athas, people whisper about your power and your intentions. Cities and merchant houses send envoys, bringing you tribute and seeking your favor. Raiders, refugees, escaped slaves, and fugitives flock to you. Some come to learn from you, and others come to fight on your behalf. Between your adventures, a mighty entourage surrounds you. Yet despite your acclaim, you are quick to strike out on your own or with a few trusted companions when adventure calls. Only cowards would have others fight on their behalf.

Magic is less complex than most believe it to be. Beneath the incantations, the beautifully fashioned implements, the intricately carved circles and sigils, and the lore scribbled in tomes unnumbered lies one simple truth: Everything is energy. Energy comes in many forms, but once the first fundamental truth is grasped, all later use of magic becomes applied manipulation of energy. Energy can be tuned, directed, drawn away, or multiplied. It can be slowed so that it seems to be a solid, or converted to an insubstantial fluid of potential.
Others who lack your understanding find you obscure or mystical, but in fact you could not be more practical. In the grand scheme of things, only energy is eternal and true; all its shapes and flows are temporary, and will shift into unrecognizable patterns as time advances.
Your comprehension of these truths grants you exceptional and growing power over the world that others believe is mostly physical. Hazardous discharges flow around you like water. You can even extend a fraction of your protection to your allies. So powerful is your control over energy that when your body takes too much hurt, you can convert yourself to a field of substanceless particles.

Legendary sovereigns come to power in a variety of ways. Some are born to royalty—the scions of existing dynasties. These sovereigns reverse the flagging fortunes of their homelands, defeat ancestral enemies, or usher in ages of expansion and prosperity. Other sovereigns establish new dynasties, building monarchies to heal a land or carve a new kingdom out of the wilderness. A few legendary sovereigns seize power by deposing tyrants and leading nations to freedom. Finally, a handful of legendary sovereigns win their thrones by acclaim. They are chosen by the people to take up the mantle of leadership after performing deeds of renown and demonstrating wisdom and courage.

In the days before acceding to your throne, you won ever-growing renown throughout the land you were destined to rule. An anonymous adventurer in other lands, you were a hero to the people of your home. People crowded the streets to catch a glimpse of you. You accrued accolades, honors, and titles, and the people began to wonder whether you might someday claim the throne. As threats arose, the people of the land sought your opinions and counsel. They treated you as a great leader, and soon, your destiny to become a lord was apparent.

Your ultimate destiny is certain to be colorful, but is otherwise open-ended. It is likely to be whatever best suits the unique expression of your class.

You might be a great bard whose magic eventually challenges the immortals, and perhaps wins you a place in the courts of the gods on your own terms. You might be a wizard whose studies have rewarded you with a natural fluency that none could have predicted early in your career, but whose popularity and notoriety live on for centuries afterward—aided by the fact that you remain accessible, if inactive, in a grand tower hidden in a Feywild mountain pass. </specific>

Your reputation as a powerful spellcaster has only grown in the telling, perhaps sometimes even outpacing your actual abilities. Indeed, some credulous few have gone so far as to call you the “mouth of magic,” implying that you are the ultimate expert on all things arcane.
You don&apos;t go out of your way to dissuade such talk. After all, you are a powerful practitioner of the arcane arts. You are a protégé of powerful wizards, sorcerers, and warlocks (if not in the f lesh, at least in the study of their lives, their rituals, and the spells they preferred to cast). Furthermore, spells and rituals have been your daily fare for longer than you can recall. You are mortal, yes, but the f lux of magic that daily f lows through your form lifts you closer and closer to something finer with each arcane utterance.
Any wizard, warlock, or other spellcaster can study hard and eventually master a wide variety of magical stratagems. It is not impossible to grow in power and ability. But a few who do so sense an underlying unity to magic, a thread that connects apparently disparate magical functions. Those few, like you, claim the title of Magister and the enhanced magical prowess that goes with it.
Regardless of what others say or what you believe, empirical evidence has proved it: You have become one of the most powerful spellcasters in history. You manipulate magic as easily as you breathe.

As you mastered your art, you realized that many are reckless with their talents. Like arcane magic, psionic power harbors the potential to unleash incalculable destruction. To avert catastrophe, you realized that any who dabble in these mysterious techniques must be watched, guided, and taught to control their talents. 	Your revelation and growing power attracted the Order, an ancient society of psionic adepts who stand apart from the land's struggles. The Order is concerned only with maintaining balance among those who wield psionic power.

The act of completing your final quest also proved that you could change the course of the unfolding cosmic yarn according to your own desires. Your mastery over the illusion that serves as creation&apos;s tissue is nearly complete. Only a few final threads of figment elude you.
So you retreat from all the competing stories of the world, fading into the illusion, becoming a part of it. When next you take a step, you do not emerge as a discrete entity only feet away from your previous position. Instead, your body and mind leap into a thousand different stories in a thousand different times and places. You seek to become part of the underlying story, the first story, the parable that precedes all others. In so doing, you hope to promote yourself above all others. No longer will you be a character in the story, but the storyteller. </specific>

The world is not real. It is a story whose teller is the cosmos itself, a cosmos unaware of its own ongoing process of coming more fully into being. Time is an illusion, merely a prop for the unfolding tale. Without time, matter, too, is mere imagination. Gods and mortals, primordials and angels, and every other creature that strives, lives, and dies upon the stage of supposed existence, is facade thrown up by the cosmos. The solid-seeming earth is anything but, and the distinctions between the heavenly realms and the infernalmost pits is a paper-thin fiction.
Or, at least, such is your creed, and you have good reason to believe it&apos;s true. The wise know that stories are narratives that give structure to knowledge, and you are wiser than most. This narrative principle runs far more deeply than most presume—you believe it is the core axiom of creation itself. However, knowing reality for the illusion it is, you have begun to alter your own story. In so doing, you have risen above the masses that still believe r ealityis more than a cloak over the nothingness that lies beneath everything. In taking a hand in your own tale, you have become a living parable, perhaps one capable of wrenching existence onto a track designed by you.

You were sent by the Raven Queen to slay a great threat to the cosmos, one that could unravel the very foundation of the planes. Though the Raven Queen is the mistress of death, she is usually content to allow each creature to find its death as its fate decrees. When death and misery spread on too wide a scale against the natural order, to the point when all life is threatened, a Perfect Slayer arises at her command.

As a Perfect Slayer, this might be your first incarnation as a mortal or one of many uncounted iterations. Your prior memories are misty at best, and you have only the barest understanding of the threat you have been dispatched to defeat. Perhaps you knew of the threat from the earliest days you practiced the assassin&apos;s art, but you might not have uncovered your quarry&apos;s true identity until you attained the heights of your power. You learn of your destiny only when your mistress deems it necessary. Legend holds that some day, the Raven Queen herself shall die on the blade of a Perfect Slayer. Perhaps that is the reason for her secrecy.

Your life has been an endless chase, but now the pursuit nears its end. Will you slay your quarry, or will you die in the attempt?

Though malleable in your hands, the world proves too limiting to one of your stature and talent, and so you transcend your origins to embrace your destiny.
Master of Reality: From the moment you discovered the astral seed, you have spent a measure of your time and energy to crafting this realm. Although you and a few allies eventually became able to explore the product of your work, it isn&apos;t until you complete your final quest that the growing realm awakens into a full-blown dominion—an Astral realm and haven for you and any you permit to walk its lands. With your refuge ready, you gather your things and slip through the planes to bring about its final form, raising mountains, forming seas, and welcoming those creatures you like to share in its splendor for as long as they wish to remain.
Being the master of your own realm and having complete control over its nature finds you distancing yourself from your roots. The squabbles between kingdoms, the rise and fall of empires, and the drama of ordinary people are insignificant next to the power you wield and the concerns facing you with maintaining your ever-growing dominion. Moreover,  maintaining your dominion takes work and consumes much of your attention until your forays outside your realm become fewer and fewer and until you find yourself unwilling to leave the paradise you create. In your final days, you bind your soul to the realm to preserve it forever after and thus your immortality is ensured as a testament of your imagination. </specific>

The dominions are stars in the firmament of the Astral Sea and each houses a fantastic world that evolved first from a seed of a concept and eventually blossomed into a unique world reflecting the vision and imagination from which it was spawned. Though many dominions are in the Astral Sea, others wait to take shape and join those already drifting through the silvery void. You have discovered one of these unformed realms and it&apos;s up to you to decide what form it will take.
The astral seed&apos;s evolution is slow, gradually expanding and transforming in response to your guidance. You cannot rush its formation or it will rip apart and dissolve into the silvery mists. You must also learn to hone your craft so you can develop the precision needed to sculpt the realm properly. Having the ability to create and alter the nature of this dominion in the making breeds other talents that transcend your mastery over the Astral Sea, and you bring these abilities to bear no matter where you go. You, however, apprehend these forces of creation, at first through subtle manipulation, but eventually through an unnerving mastery and ease foreshadowing your coming greatness.

Your transcendent understanding of the universe empowers you with the ability to bend and warp your environment. You gain an aura 10 that allows you to reshape reality as you see fit. During your turn, you can alter the environment in any of the following ways by spending a minor action:
• Change the temperature. Creatures that start their turns within your aura automatically take 15 cold damage or 15 fire damage (your choice). You can spend another minor action to return the temperature to normal, eliminating this damaging effect.
• Permanently transform any squares of difficult terrain within your aura into normal terrain.
• Permanently transform any squares of normal terrain within your aura into difficult terrain.
• Create breathable air in any or all squares.
• Fill 9 unoccupied squares with a solid surface, such as stone or wood. If you fill a square with a solid surface that is not attached to another surface (in other words, you create a stone slab 5 squares up in the air), the surface hovers in place.

      <specific name="Immortality"> Immortality
There are many paths to joining the archdevils&apos; ranks, and they include murder, betrayal, treachery, and everything in between. The following describes one possible route to a palace overlooking a sea of fire.
Infernal Apotheosis: Knowing what&apos;s in store for you, you spent your career working to secure a place of power within the Nine Hells&apos; hierarchy. You might take a hand in infernal politics, moving through mortal spheres to pit the archdevils and their dukes against one another, or you might wage war against a particular archdevil, vowing to end the dark lord&apos;s evil regime. Regardless of the method, your final enemy&apos;s defeat brings about the appointed hour and your time in the mortal world is at an end.
For your efforts, Asmodeus summons you to his grim palace in a puff of brimstone smoke. The Lord of Nessus demands your fealty, compelling you to intone the blasphemous oaths of service whether you want to or not. In recognition for your mortal deeds, you are awarded a domain within the Nine Hells, perhaps as a vassal to another archdevil or replacing an archdevil as a lord of Hell, gaining its lands, vassals, and armies to use as you wish.
You ascent is not without its peril. Hidden enemies plot against you, while you might find it hard to stomp out old loyalties to the one you supplanted. As well, the devils are ever working against one another, each casting hungry eyes at their peer&apos;s lands. In theory, you will live forever as an immortal steward of a brooding land, but some are ready to slip a knife in your back or send armies to shatter your legions. At any time, another ambitious fool with designs on your demesne might be prepared to use the luck and favor granted by the same dread forces that raised you up. </specific>

One way or another, you&apos;re going to Hell. The reasons are many. You might have drawn the fell attention of an archdevil who seeks to name you as its heir. You might have made an unwise bargain, selling your soul in exchange for temporal power. Or you could be a devil&apos;s lost scion, only now realizing your heritage&apos;s full potential. It might not be fair and could be a gross injustice, but you can&apos;t change fate. Your place lies within the fiery dominion and only by accepting your destiny can you use it to your advantage.
Undoubtedly, your curse (or blessing) has manifested itself in omens and the behavior of those you meet. Babies cry, animals grow uneasy, and your eyes have a tendency to flash red when you&apos;re angry, all pointing toward darkness in your blood. Consultations with seers and soothsayers offer glimpses of what&apos;s in store for you, including grim warnings of plots and treacheries fomented hidden rivals and enemy archdevils who fear your ascent. Indeed, the emergence of a new archdevil comes at a price to those who hold their own kingdoms in the Nine Hells, and none are willing to surrender their might to an upstart mortal. As a result, enemies lay in wait to all sides, plotting and conniving to bring about your downfall.
Contrary to what you might expect, you don&apos;t have to be evil to rule in the Nine Hells, though being all dark and nasty goes far to making sure you hold onto what you take. Anyone with a firm hand can claim a place in the infernal realms, and maybe, just maybe, change the dominion in a small way, at least until the Lord of Nessus smacks you down.

The ancient, long-lived pyreens embody all life on Athas. In their features are the traits of every race. Many of them share ancestry with the primal spirits. From your early years, you felt a kinship with these rare and elusive creatures. As time went on, and your primal power grew, you became one of them.
	As a powerful primal protector, you guard a vast region of land. The Forest Ridge or the Estuary of the Forked Tongue might be under your personal protection. The spirits of the land listen to your counsel and regard you as one of them. They exalt you, because you have the ability to restore the world to verdant glory.
	As a pyreen, you can never die from old age. This quality gives you a perspective others lack: The things worth fighting for in the world are those that last. Though you might assist people in fixing what you regard as trivial plights, you rarely put your life in jeopardy for their sakes. You know that a much greater destiny awaits you.

Some say that the souls of the greatest heroes are tied to the Prophecy, and that they cannot truly rest until their destiny is fulfilled. You are the vessel for such a spirit—a champion of the past reborn in an age that needs you. It&apos;s possible that you are truly the hero returned and that your body was somehow reconstituted or preserved. Dolurrh&apos;s Dawn is one example of how this could happen, but you could just as easily be a hero spirited away to Thelanis or bound in mysticslumber by Sora Teraza, whose true memory has only just returned. Alternatively, you could be a modern vessel for an ancient spirit. The Valenar elves have long claimed that a great hero could become an avatar for an even greater champion of the past; whether you are an elf channeling one of the warriors of Xen&apos;drik or a paladin drawing on the soul of Tira Miron, you are living proof of this theory.
	As a reborn champion, your greatest strength is the skill that you possess. You might not have the raw might of a Demigod or the impossible luck of a Deadly Trickster, but your skills and heroism are the stuff of legend. You&apos;re not just a cutpurse, you&apos;re the greatest pickpocket history has ever known, and Thievery comes as easily to you as breathing. You might not possess the sheer spellpower of the Archmage, but you might know more about Arcana than anyone alive.
	Every reborn champion has a different destiny—a quest tied to your past. This is something you need to determine with the DM, but be sure to clearly tie it to known legends. For example, if you are the reborn champion of Tira Miron (founder of the modern church of the Silver Flame), you might need to defeat a great uprising of the demon Overlords. If you are the reborn champion of Galifar I, it might be your task to reunite the Five Nations under the banner of Galifar; if you are the reborn champion of Karrn the Conqueror, you might also want to unite the nations, but under the banner of Karrnath. A Valenar champion might seek vengeance against the dragons who destroyed all the nations of Xen&apos;drik. A kalashtar reborn champion might be the key to transforming Dal Quor from a realm of nightmares to a place of light. Sometimes, you might not even know why you&apos;ve returned. You&apos;re the greatest pickpocket in the history of Galifar, and your skills are the stuff of legends, but you never planned on saving the world. But the Prophecy has a plan for you—and it will take your nimble fingers to pluck the Ring of Deepest Shadows from the fingers of Erandis d&apos;Vol when she seeks to claim the Throne of Endless Night. All that is certain is that this is a task that only you can accomplish—one so important that your spirit could not be allowed to pass on until it was done.
	Depending on whether you are truly the hero reborn or a spirit possessing a new body, the other people of the age might recognize your true nature. Being known as a reborn champion can be a blessing and a curse. Some people are quick to offer their allegiance, either out of respect for your ancient deeds or because they hope to be part of your new legend. But others might not be so helpful. Queen Aurala won&apos;t be happy to hear about the return of Kaius the Conqueror, and Cardinal Krozen might see a reborn Tira Miron as a threat to his own ambitions. Some might call you a fraud. Beyond this, the many stories about you ensure that your enemies know about your skills and talents; a successful DC 20 History check can provide a character with a clear rundown of your abilities.

Tales of your exploits will inspire people on the spirit way as they battle evil deities and demon princes. The best part of these stories is that somewhere, someone hearing them will be touched by your spirit and will create a new piece of the primal story. </specific>

You know that some primal souls leave the world behind to join the mystery after death. Other transcendent heroes join the spirits, flowing through the world to give it life and preserve its natural order. Still other primal champions reincarnate into new bodies, returning as new exemplars of nature.

You long suspected that you were one of the spirits who regularly return to the world in new bodies, though you could not be certain until the day you attained epic power. As your epic destiny opened before you, so did the memories of your past lives, a long chain of heroes, leaders, humble souls, and conquerors who lived in harmony with the spirits.

You are a champion of the spirit way, a defender of the world&apos;s primal cycles. In this life, you finally have the chance to put the knowledge and power of all your incarnations together.

The Revered One walks a perilous road, for not all powerful entities wish for enlightenment and understanding to dawn on the mortal world.
Truth Revealed: You have traveled to the farthest corners of the universe, stood fast against heavenly legions, battled armies of devils, and thwarted demonic hordes. You have traveled the Astral Sea&apos;s dominions and explored the Elemental Chaos in your search for understanding. At last you are within reach of the wellspring of all existence. Upon completing your Destiny Quest, you receive a vision, a golden path stretching into infinity. Unshakable in the power of your convictions, you take the first step on this final journey, slipping beyond this reality and vanishing from view. The road ahead is long and strange, but your journey is only beginning. For ages to come, mortals will follow in your footsteps, guided by your teachings and inspired by your example. </specific>

As the result of long reflection, unflinching morals, and a lifetime of pious service to the gods, you have developed a powerful new philosophy of the mortal place in the cosmos. You have glimpsed the truth of the infinite, the timeless expanse to which mortal souls eventually go, and your insights have the power to change the world. Your teachings are destined to bring hope and enlightenment to people for centuries to come, for glimpses of truth lie within the words you have set down and within the story of your deeds.
Your philosophy might seem, at first glance, to trivialize the gods and their dominions, but you recognize that the gods are necessary intermediaries between mortals and the infinite. You therefore honor all deities as examples for mortals to learn from. Your sermons, your writings, or the stories of your life have the power to help followers of many different gods to understand the lessons of the mortal world.
The exact nature of your revelations is up to you. You might be a visionary who perceives the eventual fate of mortal souls and teaches others how their actions in this world influence their ultimate destinies. You might be a reformer whose teachings challenge inflexible, age-old doctrines of great temples. You might be a philosopher who maintains a creed of stoicism, a fiery condemnation of evil, or an ethical system of obligation to others. Or perhaps you instruct your initiates in darker truths that incite greed, hedonism, or tyranny—not all who follow this path find philosophies of peace and enlightenment, after all.

      <specific name="Immortality"> Immortality?
When you complete your final quest, you make your plans to withdraw from the world. You have accumulated so much knowledge that you have become a force of nature itself. As one of a select few who have earned the title Sage of Ages, you take up the lonely task of a keeper of secrets, history, and unfettered knowledge.
When the time is right, you retreat to a secret place only you know of, a place where you find knowledge within the natural bends and crevices in space and time. You begin to observe a river of events and store them away in your mind. Age, cares, and the needs of the flesh flow around you, not through you. You are a fountainhead of knowledge that other creatures, sometimes even gods, seek out because of your perfect enlightenment. </specific>

Knowledge is power, freedom, life, and love. With the proper information, you can unravel the secrets of the universe and be the master of your own fate. You have always believed this. Your curiosity about all things is legendary. Even as a child, you asked “why?” more often than any other question. As you matured, you sought knowledge about harder-to-reach places, traveling first the world, then other planes of existence. Knowledge is your solace, your hope, and your support. Faith might be fine for others, but you see it as a shallow edifice. Only objective study and the knowledge gained thereby allows one to see things as they truly are.
The petty bickering of kings and nobles holds less and less interest for you, and as you learn more and more about the facade of flesh that mortals wear to hide their souls, even earthly delights begin to lose their flavor. All else pales before the pursuit of pure knowledge.

The knowledge of life as many different people, ranging all the way back to the earliest days of the most ancient races, informs your perspective and reminds you that memories, knowledge, and skills still live on deep in the minds of others.

Immortal World Walker: As you draw closer to the completion of your Destiny Quest, more and more memories begin to flood your mind from lives both recent and ancient. As the memories threaten to overwhelm your own personality, you learn to harness their knowledge and perform miracles that you would not have normally thought you could achieve.

When you have embraced your destiny, you fully merge with the memories of your past lives; no longer do they surface from time to time, but you call upon them at will, as though you had experienced all they had to offer in this lifetime. You transcend who you are, becoming, instead, an amalgamation of everyone you have ever been. This transformation permeates every fiber of your being, including your physical form, and you cease to be troubled by mortal concerns such as aging or a natural death. You have walked the world from its most ancient days, and continue to do so, full of memories dating back to the first days of creation. </specific>

The soul of a deva is reborn each time it dies, leaving the deva with relatively fresh memories from past lifetimes. However, some spirits are reincarnated over and over again throughout the centuries, each as different races and with different professions. When one of these reincarnating spirits is reborn as a deva, it creates an unusual situation where the deva can recall past lives beyond those recalled by most devas.

You are one of these few who can cast their thoughts far back in time, calling upon memories of lives as humans, elves, dwarves, and other races. You might have memories of life as a dragonborn warrior defending the walls of an Arkhosian fortress, and maybe you recall the First Days when you and your fellow elves first walked the forests of the world. You remember being among the dwarf crafters as you laid the foundation for the first buildings in Hammerfast, and the taste of bitter betrayal as you stood with your fellow tieflings in the ashes of Bael Turath.

You have an uncanny sense of time unlike that possessed by your fellow devas. Also, unlike other devas, you cannot say for certain that you will be reborn again with the knowledge of your past lives, and you must seize this rare chance to make use of the memories you possess. With knowledge of the world from the dawn of time, you have a chance to see the greater picture and gain the kind of scope you need to make history-altering changes that frequently remain only within the domain of gods.

Your origin changes to elemental. Additionally, you gain resist lightning and thunder equal to 15 + one-half your level. Additionally, you gain an aura 5; any creature that enters or begins its turn within your aura loses any resistance to lightning or thunder. Whenever you make an attack, you can choose to have the attack deal lightning and thunder damage instead of its normal damage.

Once per day, when you die, your body discorporates into a storm of elemental fury. You heal to one-half hit points and gain the insubstantial and phasing qualities. You gain an aura 5, and when enemies begin their turns inside that aura they automatically take 15 lightning and thunder damage, and you can slide that enemy 3 squares. You can use encounter and atwill powers, but you cannot use daily powers, activate magic items, or perform rituals. If you die in elemental storm form, you are dead.
At the end of the encounter, after a short rest, you reconstitute yourself from the base elements. Your current hit point total is unchanged, but you no longer experience the other benefits and drawbacks from being in elemental storm form.

As you grow ever more enlightened about the thievery and trickery that you had mastered in your past life, reality once again begins to bend around you, allowing you to steal things that others say can never be taken.
The Greatest Prize: Despite the fact that your skills can be used for greed and self-service, you have been spun back into the world for some purpose. You have one great thing that you must steal—one bit of thievery for which you were given a new life and incarnation. This prize is the subject of your Destiny Quest; you might be destined to steal the magic away from an ancient dracolich or to place your hands on the only artifact that can slay the dark goddess Lolth. Once you steal the object of your Destiny Quest, you have fulfilled your role in the world. Only then can you once again have the power to take what lies beyond the grasp of all mortals, as you finally recall the full extent of the techniques that allow you to filch the intangible. </specific>

Long ago, there lived a thief who was so skilled at the art of taking that nothing was outside his grasp. Some said that he could steal the throne out from underneath a king, make off with the princess&apos;s smile, and snatch the stars from the night sky—all over the course of a single evening! How much of the thief &apos;s myth was true and how much has become the tall tales of legend is a matter of debate, but few take such stories seriously. Such tales border on the ridiculous for most people, but you know the truth: The legends are real, and you are that Thief of Legend reborn.
	The Thief of Legend could do all of the fantastic things that people today describe. This thief had fingers so light and nimble that some said he could steal the crown off the queen without her even noticing. His movements were so quiet that death could not track him. His plans were so cunning that he outwitted the gods at every turn. Artifacts guarded by thousands of angels vanished from Astral domains, and the only evidence that remained of the thief &apos;s passing were the faint echoes of laughter where treasures once were held.
	Yet these feats have, on occasion, been reproduced by other mortals. The true point of transition between master thief and Thief of Legend came when this thief learned how to steal things that are intangible. So great was this legendary thief &apos;s skill that reality bent to his trickery. He discovered ways to steal laughter, or memories, or the color from a painting. Now, generations later, that thief has been reborn, and you are coming to realize that you are the reincarnation of this famous thief. Over time, you have begun to recall the tricks and techniques that you mastered in that former life, and you are growing once more into the master thief that the stories still describe.

	When you die, after 1 hour your body and possessions vanish. After 24 hours, you reappear alive and at full hit points at a safe place of your choosing, that is familiar to you, and that is on the same plane where you died.
	In addition, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points or fewer, you can steal something intangible from that creature, such as the color of the creature&apos;s eyes or its memories of its kingdom. The mechanical effects of this theft, if any, are left to the Dungeon Master.

Constant pressure causes the Far Realm&apos;s corrupting influence to leak through even the smallest breaches into the natural world, spawning horrors that tear at the fabric of existence. These breaches represent some of the greatest dangers to the mortal realm, and generations of heroes have dedicated themselves to maintaining the integrity of the Far Realm&apos;s boundaries. Over a lifetime&apos;s adventuring, however, you have grown weary of this ultimately doomed effort.
	For each fissure that is closed, two more open elsewhere. Worse, how many of the fault lines riddling creation remain undetected? The Far Realm relentlessly seeks to corrupt the mortal realm, but whereas most heroes seek only to defend against the Outside&apos;s malign influence, you have a better idea. You will turn the tide on the Far Realm by assaulting its borders, its creatures—its very nature. And if you cannot reshape the Far Realm with the benign influence of the natural world, you will destroy it utterly to eliminate the threat it represents.

Each of your past lives has ended in a heroic death staving off a superior number of enemies. Is it your fate to always die alone in order that others might live? Or does each successive death provide you with more knowledge, so that in one incarnation you rise victorious rather than falling to their assault?

The only question is . . . can you survive it? If you face your enemies head-on, stemming the tide of battle and keeping your allies safe, can you find victory that does not end in death? If you live, your heroic stand becomes the subject of new legends, and for a time you can walk the earth as the living embodiment of your combat prowess. If you fall in battle, your memory will echo through the ages, your sacrifice never forgotten. Shrines might be erected in your honor, and statues might be raised where you fell in battle. Other organizations will look to you as their hero and role model, fashioning an ethos that will carry on for generations based on your heroic death. </specific>

When you close your eyes and put yourself to rest, visions of an ancient battle rise unbidden to the front of your mind. Wave after wave of your enemies rush toward you. Your allies have already fled, making their way to safety. You volunteered to stay behind, to act as the stopper in the bottle that would keep your enemies from rushing through to their objective. You stood alone, in the face of overwhelming defeat, and yet death did not claim you right away. As the ground became slick with the blood of your enemies, you held their forces at bay. Your allies escaped, and you perished only once their safety was assured.
	That was long ago, in another life. The memories of that fateful day, the day in a past life in which you died so that your allies might live, have only begun to return to you as you became powerful enough to embrace such a fate. That day you became a legend, and now you know that you have been reincarnated so that you can once again lay your life on the line to defend your allies. You are the shield that stands between your enemies and those you would protect, and just as you once held many legions at bay, so too will you again let your enemies smash themselves upon you like waves on the rocks.
	As you have grown in strength and prowess, the visions of that ancient battle, and others like it fought across many lives, have slowly come into focus. With every step forward, you remember more details and see those memories with more clarity until you can recall each heroic death in crystal-clear detail. By the time you learn the nature of your Destiny Quest, you have reclaimed memories of dozens of battles, spread across as many centuries, where you acted as the final bulwark against your enemies&apos; assaults. Now, you begin to reclaim many lives&apos; worth of experiences as your own, building upon the knowledge you gained in countless battles against overwhelming odds, once again preparing yourself for the final battle where you might stand alone once more against legions of foes.
