	You might choose to take on powers from a second class in place of a paragon path. If you have the Multiclass Power feat for a class, you can choose to continue to gain powers from that class rather than take a paragon path. If you choose this option, you gain several benefits.
		At 11th level, you can choose to replace one of your at-will powers with an at-will power from your second class.
		In place of the paragon path encounter power gained at 11th level, you can select any encounter power of 7th level or lower from your second class.
		In place of the paragon path utility power gained at 12th level, you can select any utility power of 10th level or lower from your second class.
		In place of the paragon path daily power gained at 20th level, you can select any daily power of 19th level or lower from your second class.
		At level 11, you receive two extra multiclass feats of your choice.
		At level 16, you receive one free feat of any type you qualify for.
		Psionic Augmentation: If either of your classes has the Psionic Augmentation class feature and you choose paragon multiclassing, the benefits you gain at 11th level are different from those noted above.
		If your first and second classes both have the Psionic Augmentation class feature, at 11th level you gain 2 power points and an at-will attack power of 7th level or lower from your second class.
		If your first class has the Psionic Augmentation class feature and your second class doesn't have it, at 11th level you gain an at-will attack power from your second class as well as an encounter attack power of 7th level or lower from that class.
		If your first class doesn't have the Psionic Augmentation class feature and your second class does have it, at 11th level you lose one at-will attack power from your first class but gain 2 power points and an at-will attack power of 7th level or lower from your second class.

Walking unseen among a thankless populace are agents of the Unbroken Circle—a unity of avengers in service to the goddess Erathis. Each agent is sworn to root out and destroy forces that foul the goodness of mortal hearts. They wage a constant war against growing evil, defending civilization and the honor of Nerath from the closing jaws of tyranny and corruption.

As an agent of the Unbroken Circle, you take on corruption wherever you find it—and since you actively look for it, you find a great deal of it. Whether you&apos;re based in a population center and spend most of your time there or travel far afield in search of those who have fallen morally and ethically, you rely on your skills as an avenger and the ones you gain as an agent to handle combat situations and provide support to those with whom you travel. Due to your constant vigilance for signs of corruption, you have found few you can trust, and you always formulate an escape plan in every situation, just in case the ones you rely upon fail you.

You&apos;ve never been content to stick to one path. Magic and larceny, spell and trap, dweomer and shadow—for you, all came easy. You learned to fuse your knowledge into one style, both in and out of battle.

When you were a child, you dreamed of grand achievements. You enjoyed the shows of illusionists and magicians, and you reveled in the skill of pickpockets and burglars. You followed two divergent paths that eventually came together in your mind as a way of life and a cohesive style of attack. You don&apos;t separate the martial from the magical, and you are mildly scornful of anyone who is so shortsighted as to make this division.

You never sought a position in an arcane order or a thieves&apos; guild; you didn&apos;t want to limit yourself. Instead, you learned to recognize that each adventure is an opportunity to test your mettle, sharpen your skills, enhance your magic, and discover treasures.

Eladrin are naturals for this path because of their agility and keen intellect. Arcane tricksters are found among gnomes, changelings, and drow as well. Some use their knowledge and power for adventure, and others use it for theft, torture, and deception.

Under the cloak of night, tyrants and murderers grow restless. They sense an intent gaze upon them, like a bird of prey circling in for the kill. Sometimes this unease is enough to discourage despicable acts. But far too often, a more direct course of action needs to be taken, and the silvered head of an arrow puts down evil.

The Arrows of the Moonbow are a scattered sect of sworn brothers and sisters who dedicate their lives to ensuring that each mortal has a fair chance at writing his or her own destiny and changing his or her own stars. The Arrows travel far and wide, seeking no reward but that which they confiscate from the corpses of their targets. All sorts of divine heroes work among their ranks but, regardless of inclination, they all come to favor subterfuge, trickery and, above all, stealth.

Lolth's return and a resumption of the disastrous war that nearly shattered the elven peoples cast a terrible shadow across Corellon's priesthood. Anticipating this event, the elders formed the Azure Guard who would one day serve as the principle leaders in repelling Lolth's demonic forces. The warriors combine prayers to Corellon with secret arcane spells to achieve the edge they need to overcome their enemies. Azure Guard members do not advertise their special status lest they invite assassins to strike at them. One cannot join the Azure Guard without invitation, and even those called to serve in its esteemed ranks may find themselves unequal to the demands the training makes.

A knight of the eladrin courts, you are pledged to the service of the lords of the fey. Along with valor and martial skill, you have shown exceptional patience, grace, and compassion—qualities admired in eladrin and elven realms alike. You follow a personal code that resembles the chivalric traditions of the mortal world, but you bring a fey perspective to the concepts of honor, valor, and fidelity. Most knights are obligated to prove their bravery by declining advantages that reduce risk in battle, but you do not scorn the bow, the spell, or the ruse of war when such tactics are effective. You have learned techniques for making the best use of agility and quickness even while wearing the heaviest armor.

Among the eladrin, those who follow this path are known as the Aelavellin Seldarine—the Sword Knights of the Seldarine. Most such champions are eladrin, elves, or half-elves, for Corellon is the patron of these peoples. However, any noble warrior devoted to the lord of the Seldarine can become a champion of Corellon. Those champions of Corellon who are of other races find a warm welcome in most eladrin and elven communities and are usually regarded as ruathar (“star-friends”), honored allies.

All warlocks make dangerous bargains with powers far beyond mortal understanding. Most do so cautiously, closing off portions of their soul to whatever fell entity they made a pact with. They fear what they might become if they get too close. They fear they might become you.
	Few are willing to grapple with dark forces as closely as you are, to look the deranged visages of unholy entities squarely in the eye. You are strong enough to control the darkness inside you. You wager your very soul daily, risking utter damnation in exchange for a dark reward. Your body is but a fetter now, anchoring you to a world that no longer seems to be yours. You walk toward a darker place now, a few steps farther every day, leaving the light at your back.
	You stand between worlds, a wraithlike shadow who wrestles with greater evil than most will ever know. The dark forces within you cry out for your soul, and so far you&apos;ve denied them, harnessing their unearthly power for your own purposes, but every day it grows harder to step back into the light.

The wizard Kelgore's arcane knowledge was matched only by his unbounded rages. This spell is said to be the product of one such fit (prompted by a troublesome fey intent on teleporting away with Kelgore's spellbooks). Like magic missile, this spell hits with perfect accuracy, and it is favored by those who know they won't have the chance for a second shot.

No force stands in greater opposition to the world&apos;s evils than the Church of the Silver Flame. Its holy warriors are embroiled in an eternal war against demons, devils, lycanthropes, and undead. Foremost among the Silver Flame&apos;s divine servants are the exorcists of the Silver Flame. These individuals travel the world, devoting their lives to deeds that exemplify the faith&apos;s precepts.
As an exorcist of the Silver Flame, you enjoy a powerful connection to the Silver Flame and have become a living vessel for the power that underpins the Church. The Voice of the Flame specifically selected you for this service, and it falls to you to uncover corruption and purge it from this world. You have hardened yourself against the grisly deeds you must perform to eliminate evil. You unleash the power of your faith upon your enemies, scorching them with flames that purify the iniquitous and bolster the righteous. Whenever you use your prayers, a small silver flame appears above your head to identify the holiness of your cause and the stature of your position within the Church.

You can choose a second form for your familiar. You can use a minor action to switch your familiar between forms; or when you switch your familiar's mode, you can also switch its form as a free action. For example, you could have a familiar that changes between cat form and owl form. If you retrain the Arcane Familiar feat to replace your familiar, you can replace both forms.

In addition, if your familiar would take damage, you may instead have it enter passive mode as a free action.

You&apos;ve felt a love for the wilderness for your entire life. Its grand vistas impress you, and even its smallest wonders give you reason for delight. When you learned of Mielikki, it was like reuniting with a longtime friend. You&apos;ve striven at length in her service, and your efforts have not gone unrewarded.

Mielikki smiles upon those who pursue peace with the natural world and share that view with others. Thus you strive to spread understanding of nature&apos;s laws even as you battle to uphold them. It is not enough to protect the world from those who live in it. Instead, those who live in the world must be taught to protect it. Of course, a student does not learn from a teacher with infinite patience; those too stubborn or stupid to learn the error of their ways do not deserve nature&apos;s many gifts.

Your rapport with the elemental powers has grown to such a degree that they regard you as one of their own. Throughout the heroic tier, you established yourself as an able partner, ally, and, perhaps, servant of the elemental powers and in doing so earned greater and greater elemental rewards, including advanced arcane knowledge and more powerful spells. So armed, you stand ready to face even greater threats and reap even greater rewards.
	The elemental powers' favor grants you deeper insights into elemental magic. Not only can your gen servant fetch potent spells, but you can pierce the barriers between the planes to draw forth power to serve your needs. Such command over creation's fundamental forces translates into an improved gen servant that, at your command, can manifest the Elemental Chaos's unruly energies in effective and dangerous ways. Not only does your gen servant improve, but when you master all the elemental gifts, you can transform your servant into a powerful elemental monolith.

The bond between hunter and prey is as old as life itself. This relationship is second nature to you—a way of life that helps you work with other hunters, combining all your skill to bring down even the deadliest quarry. By learning and applying the secrets of the first hunter, you have honed your warden powers for maximum efficiency with spears and other thrown weapons. Whether you fight from the front or strike from the side, your allies can rely on you.

If you finally become the prey, let your hunter beware. You walk with the spirits of ancestral hunters at your side, and foes that corner you will feel the bite of your weapon.

You can use any one-handed simple or military weapon as a thrown weapon with a normal range of 5 and a long range of 10.

Serendipity favors you. You have long proved a constant and loyal servant to Avandra by making her interests your own in your ongoing struggle against tyranny and in your willingness to explore the world and sample all it has to offer. Your virtuous soul and good works have won you the goddess&apos;s favor, and although you know you were ever in her good graces, you realize you have only touched upon what is possible in her service.

Becoming fortune blessed makes luck your servant, yours to shape and manipulate as you desire. The goddess permits this mastery as long as you advance her aims in the world and remain pure of heart and purpose. You have a knack for husbanding your good fortune and turning setbacks to your advantage. The greater your power becomes, the more the impossible becomes possible until one day you find there is nothing you can&apos;t achieve with luck on your side.

You exemplify the virtues of Erathis. In life, you abide by and enforce the laws of your people. You have defended your home against myriad creeping evils and brought light to the dark places in the world. In battle, you know you are only as powerful as the warriors who fight beside you, and you strive to guide them to victory just as fervently as you take up a weapon. Erathis has taken special notice of your devotion and your prowess, and she has blessed you with a powerful touch of her golden light.

To be a gatekeeper of the golden palace, as you are, one does not need a specific power source or skill set. One needs only to value the lives of their allies as strongly as their own, and to know that it is more important for an arrow to strike its target than it is to be the one who fires the arrow. With your allies at your side and Erathis in your heart, you intend to litter the battlefield with fallen enemies—even if you never lift a sword.

The Monastery of the Eternal Void stands at a crossroads where the Shadowfell washes against the world&apos;s shores. Some who study in the monastery delve into the Shadowfell&apos;s secrets, but most of the disciples there contemplate the nature of life and death, the soul&apos;s final migration, and the fate awaiting creatures in the afterlife. Proximity to the darkened plane informed the monastery&apos;s fighting techniques as they developed into their current forms.

Your training at the monastery opened your inner eye, allowing you glimpses from this world into the realm of the dead. Those visions left a mark on you; your flesh grew pale and dark circles ring your eyes, as if death&apos;s touch draws near. Despite these changes, you are no less vital and have gained uncanny insight into the nature of souls and their movements.

As a ghostwalker, you use psionic power to cloak yourself in shadow and thereby avoid enemy attacks. You can also strike at a foe&apos;s life force, sapping its strength. Mastery of these techniques allows you to seize your enemy&apos;s soul and ride it to another location.

As a devotee of Moradin, you have dedicated yourself to the destruction of your god&apos;s traditional enemies and the protection of his faith. In return for your dedication, Moradin lends strength to your hand and shields you with his power. In some lands, hammers of Moradin form an elite knightly order of clerics and paladins who defend dwarven citadels. Others are solitary agents of order who use their powers to protect the weak and confront injustice wherever they encounter it.

Although many hammers of Moradin are dwarves, any hero who wields Moradin&apos;s divine power is free to choose this path. Champions of many races turn to Moradin for the strength to hold back evil and defeat the wicked. Human knights, eladrin swordsmiths, and dragonborn battle-priests are all numbered among the hammers of Moradin.

You are a champion of Sune, goddess of love and beauty. You delight in art, music, dance, poetry, and all other pursuits that lend beauty to mortal lives. Romance is certainly at the forefront of these, but you are no simple hedonist—to you, a courtship marked by chivalry and gallant gestures is the highest expression of true love.
	You oppose cruelty, callousness, and tyranny in all their forms. Evil creatures often seek to hoard or destroy things of beauty, and hold no love in their hearts. You seek to protect love wherever it exists and set right any wrongs that interfere with love&apos;s intended course. Daring quests and long-nurtured hopes stir your heart, especially those that lead to the flowering of beauty in a place where evil once held sway. Although you do not take pleasure in combat, sometimes evil can be checked by no other means. Through your devotion and loyalty to your companions, Sune&apos;s divine love shields them from harm and lends courage to their hearts.
	Heartwarders are most often wandering knights, poets, and gallants who roam Faerûn&apos;s cities and courts. Most can&apos;t resist a little matchmaking, and gladly advise young suitors in the arts of romance.

In the High Forest, the secrets of the deep, old woods are closely guarded, and few know of the many wild things  that walk amid the shadowed boles. Silver stags, wise hares, unicorns, butterflies the size of hawks, and tree owls that have survived a hundred winters roam through the gloom. Living, bark-wrapped pillars hold aloft layers upon layers of a mounting canopy that filters sunlight into a hundred hues of emerald and gold. But the High Forest shelters deadly danger, too. Wild forest creatures, tattooed savages, and haunted barrows are common threats that travelers face.
	But worse lies farther in. Hideously disfigured and powerful plaguechanged creatures lurk in shadowed vales, forgotten demon servitors of Netheril wake to their masters&apos; return, and yuan-ti from Najara search for something they will not name. Many threats trouble the shadowed thickets of your home.
	These enemies do not pass unmarked. You are the ghost in the trees, the arrow on the wind, and to monstrous creatures who haunt the woods, you are swift and merciless death. The forest is your country, and you do not take kindly to uninvited guests. Neither serpentfolk nor demon can hide from your arrows.

Mortals might be flawed creations, given to error and misjudgment. But all mortals are blessed with a singular gift: the soul. Psionic energy revealed your soul&apos;s power, and through long study and introspection, you learned to navigate the labyrinthine pathways of your being.
	This energy suffuses you and surrounds you in a radiant glow. Although you can dampen your inner light, you and others around you find its presence comforting. In time, the light responds to your commands, burning your enemies while bolstering your allies, or even allowing your soul to eclipse your body.
	The more you access your soul&apos;s power, the more you understand that this essence must be guarded. Those who would exploit souls, twisting them for dark ends, and those who would hoard souls on their journey beyond the body must be destroyed and their prisoners freed. To this end, you commit yourself against the myriad villains who use or abuse souls.

The monastery you trained at followed a rare discipline, the school of the dragon&apos;s wisdom. Your masters explained that in the ancient days, the dragons taught the mightiest of mortals how to transcend their physical forms and become as mighty as a dragon. Your monastery teaches that with the right focus and discipline, you too can master the secrets of the dragon.

You learn to focus your psionic power outward, unleashing the dragon&apos;s fiery breath and turning your skin into an armored hide of dragon scales. You move with the dragon&apos;s speed, dancing on the wind with wings of psionic power. Once you master this discipline, you learn how to transform into a dragon for a brief moment.

Half-orc monks are frequently drawn to this paragon path, since their agility and strength serve them well on this path. By the same token, their fiery rage matches the dragon&apos;s anger when it is called to battle.

At the birth of every Valenar child, a Keeper of the Past is present to determine the ancestor spirit destined to guide that individual through life. At the end of every Valenar life, a Keeper of the Past judges the deeds of the deceased and ensures that particularly worthy elves are immortalized in history. In this way the Keepers of the Past lead the Valenar from the day of their birth until the day of their death. No matter the power they wield, all Keepers worship and draw upon the power of revered patron ancestors, known collectively as the Spirits of the Past. The key difference between them is not their power source so much as they way in which they draw upon that power. Shamans tend to have a personal connection with a patron ancestor (the shaman is often a direct descendant). Warlords lead by example—putting the advice imparted by ancestor spirits into practice on the battlefield. Bards inspire those around them to emulate the greatest deeds of ancient heroes. Regardless of the exact means by which you do it, as a Keeper of the Past you commune with and channel the advice, guidance, and sometimes direct power of the Spirits of the Past.

You are part of an unusual group of thieves. You are a member of House Kundarak&apos;s Ghorad&apos;din, who are charged with testing the house&apos;s wards and recovering property stolen by those brazen enough to break into Kundarak vaults. You combine the magical prowess of a spellcaster with the stealth of a burglar. As a result, no barrier can stop you.
House Kundarak uses the Ghorad&apos;din only rarely, and they answer only to Lord Morrikan, leader of House Kundarak. When a new high security vault needs testing, the house assembles a group of Ghorad&apos;din to try to break in and expose weaknesses before any treasure is placed within. Although such practices hone your skills, you might prefer even greater challenges. The most skilled Ghorad&apos;din are assigned to recover stolen property from other gifted thieves. Whispers also tell of Ghorad&apos;din who operate as assassins.

Wandering crusaders who worship the Path of Light, lightwalkers travel between kalashtar communities, helping to resolve whatever conflicts or crises they face. As a lightwalker, one month you might be dealing with problems stirred up in Sharn by the Dreaming Dark, and the next month you might be off to protect kalashtar archeologists exploring ancient ziggurats in Q&apos;barra. Many of your people are content to remain sedentary, living in isolated communities or within the temple-keeps of Adar. That life isn&apos;t for you, though. You are not satisfied unless you are actively battling against the darkness, helping to thwart the Dreaming Dark, attempting to destroy the Lords of Dust, or bringing peace to the civilizations of your people. As a lightwalker, you enjoy the light of purity and righteousness, but you recognize the need to oppose the tangible evils of the world.

Your attention now turns to far greater quarry: treasures lost to time, and riches sealed away by titans, demon lords, and worse.

In the years following the Spellplague, Lathander, the eternally young god of new beginnings and hope, transfigured into his ancient incarnation Amaunator. Although Amaunator dropped the youthful mask he had worn for centuries, his experiences as the Dawn Lord shook him from his ancient mindset. Amaunator is still a dignified god of immense age, but he remembers his youth, and he encourages his followers to do the same.
	As a Morninglord, you are the champion of your god&apos;s youth. The optimistic spirit of Lathander guides you as you seek to master the chaos of the new world. The fires of your god burn within you and lend you the inexhaustible energy of youth. You are tireless, fierce, rebellious and full of hope. You shine like a beacon in the darkest hours of night, inspiring those around you to greatness they never dreamed possible.
	To your enemies you are the searing sun itself, shedding scorching brilliance from your form. Evil is confronted by fiery annihilation in your wake, for though you walk with Lathander&apos;s carefree spirit, your heart burns with the all-consuming fire of Amaunator.

For centuries, the Oak Shields have guarded the wild areas of the world. Oak Shields, like their namesake trees, are known for longevity, hardiness, and loyalty. Legends claim that Melora personally trained the first members of the order, providing them with the secrets of using everspring groves and standing stones. Ancient sites such as these might hold information on how Melora&apos;s faithful can benefit from them.
Each aspiring Oak Shield studies under a master. Together, the student and the master meditate beneath a sacred oak, seeking enlightenment about the natural world. The student learns to interpret the of the changing seasons. During this time, he or she comes to appreciate when to stand tall against the wind and when to bend when the wind is too strong. In addition, the student learns about the complexity of the world, how something as simple as a tree can have multiple aspects to its nature. An Oak Shield applies these lessons to his or her life&apos;s work as a guardian of the natural order, remaining steadfast in the face of adversity and providing shelter during the storm.

Many dragonborn who adopt divine classes follow Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon, but few study the esoteric disciplines of the Platinum Temple. This ancient shrine, located on a remote mountain peak that is said to straddle the boundary between the natural world and Bahamut&apos;s domain in Celestia, teaches a particular form of mysticism that is unique to dragonborn, for its goal is to be increasingly formed into the likeness of Bahamut himself.

Through prayer and meditation, and more important through the rigorous discipline of walking a just and honest path through the world, you apply the teachings of the Platinum Temple to your life. You strive to think as Bahamut would and face every situation with his sense of righteousness and honor. At the same time, you train your body and channel divine power through it, until your scales begin to gleam with the silvery-white color of platinum. With time and further study, you learn to momentarily sprout great draconic wings, speak Supernal with Bahamut&apos;s own authority, and breathe a billowing mist like the Platinum Dragon&apos;s potent breath weapon.

Such power is meaningless, however, if you do not use it in service to Bahamut&apos;s highest ideals.

	Those who live outside the law are fiercely independent. Some are outcasts by nature, but most are driven to the fringes of society because a rigid authority denied them any other place. It&apos;s not easy for free spirits to acknowledge their need for leadership. You understand that those who act alone are easier to hunt down. Outlaws must be inspired to band together for their common good. That&apos;s where you come in.

	Because of your charm and your bravado, and because you never give up, you&apos;re the one they rely on for this inspiration. When times are good, you&apos;re the one they trust to divvy up the loot. On the days when the law wins, it&apos;s you who holds despair at bay and encourages your band to press on. You are a prince of knaves, and no matter what company you keep or how base you might be, none can deny that you have the dignity and magnetism of a born ruler.

	A few heroes who follow this path truly are of noble birth. Legends abound with tales of deposed aristocrats toppled from the ruling class and forced to lead a ragtag band of rebels to recapture their rightful heritage. Others hope to use their blades and their wits to carve out a new throne for themselves. Whatever the past and the future hold for you, you know that you will triumph as long as you have your friends close—and a concealed knife even closer.

The transition to death is a holy road on which all living things are pilgrims. Every creature steps onto that road at birth. When fate&apos;s appointed hour comes, every creature steps off into whatever waits beyond the finite and visible path. So it has been, and so it should be. These are the truths of the Raven Queen.
	Yet some do not hold to the proper path. Brazen mortals defy the natural order by avoiding that righteous hour of ending. A few do so by magic or other means, the most common of which is to become undead.
	Undead aren&apos;t, in and of themselves, offensive to the Raven Queen. Still, shambling dead brought back to a mockery of life through foul magic deserve to be destroyed. So do those undead that defy true death by serving other entities, such as Orcus or Vecna. A few bold souls manage to elude death without otherwise blaspheming the Raven Queen&apos;s edicts. Still, demise must come for them in time as well.
	It is the duty of any who serve the Raven Queen to bring down the proud, showing them the equality that only death provides. Within temples where the Raven Queen is esteemed above all others, the clergy offers support and training for those who would be her instruments of death. Cults form around the ideal of righteous killing, of becoming heralds of death. Common folk know of the Raven Queen&apos;s heralds and whisper of their mission when sudden loss of life visits the prideful, the wicked, or those cursed by undeath.
	You have consciously devoted yourself to becoming a tool in the Raven Queen&apos;s wintry hands. Perhaps you came to this commitment on your own, or maybe you have an affiliation with the Raven Queen&apos;s hierarchy in the world. The origin of your connection to the mistress of winter makes little difference. As a harbinger of destiny, you know that every foe who falls before you has met its appropriate end.

	Although arcanists might wield their power in different ways, all tap into the same source. By studying the techniques of other arcane classes, you discover commonalities between them all. Rather than seeing a wizard&apos;s esoteric formulas as obstacles, you learn ways around the complex mechanisms that allow you to duplicate their spells. Likewise, you find new ways to harness power in ways similar to sorcerers even though it does not well from within you. You can hurl fireballs, assemble magical servants, call forth dread magic from within, or siphon power from otherworldly beings all though the normal routines you perform with your bard spells. Armed with this new knowledge, nothing is beyond your capabilities. 

	As a resourceful magician, you manipulate arcane energy in its fundamental state. You derive even greater benefits from your diverse studies to let you better emulate other arcane class features. You also find it easier to employ arcane spells, using your power more judiciously so no spell is wasted. You might not have the raw destructive potential a sorcerer enjoys or experience the fruits of a wizard&apos;s discipline, but you do have an extensive knowledge of magic in all its myriad forms, giving you an edge when you need it most.

•	You use your Assassin's Shroud power as a free action and subject the target to an additional shroud.
•	You douse each light source in an close burst 10. Each light source must be no larger than a lantern.
	You can have up to five gloom shards at a time. After an extended rest, your unexpended gloom shards vanish, but you gain a gloom shard.

You follow the sometimes radiant and sometimes shadowy path of the mistress of the skies, Selûne. Through the world&apos;s many changes, one story remains eternal: Selûne&apos;s vigilant opposition to the machinations of her dark sister, Shar. Silverstars carry the light and hope of their goddess into the darkness, championing causes others think lost. 
	Unlike many of the other gods and goddesses, Selûne is willing to share some of her power with worshipers who are not solely devoted to studying her will. Wizards, warlocks, bards, and sorcerers can become silverstars of note.
	Before the Spellplague, Selûne&apos;s mortal concerns often centered on lycanthropes: werewolves, wereboars, werebears and other worshipers who could change into animal shapes governed by the moon. After the  Spellplague, lycanthropy spiraled beyond Selûne&apos;s benevolent control. She does what she can for its victims, but sometimes all she can do is offer a swift silver blade.

Death is the natural course for all things, from the lowly insect to the mightiest of gods. It is not an end, of course, but a beginning—the first step onto the road into the unknown. For you, death offers little fear or concern because you are confident that the Raven Queen will shepherd you to whatever fate your long service has earned. This comfort and understanding forms the cornerstone of your beliefs, and you carry this message wherever you go, consoling the grieving or speeding those who deserve to meet the Raven Queen on their way.

The tiger claw style is an ancient, honored path. Its practitioners have incorporated techniques from different traditions, but the style retains a central feature: the tiger claw. A practitioner curls his or her fingers toward the palm to make a claw. Through iron discipline, the monk transforms each digit into a rigid talon capable of raking and rending.
	Mastering tiger claw maneuvers builds your strength and hardiness, and your strikes shred enemies. You spring at your foes with astounding speed. With true mastery, you take on the characteristics of the celestial tiger. Coarse orange and white striped fur covers your body. Your hands become clawed paws and a tiger&apos;s visage replaces your features. With great green orbs for eyes and a mouth filled with sharp teeth, you embody the tiger claw style.

The Traveler is the true lord of Eberron, because his feet have treaded all its paths, and his eyes have seen all its sights. Her smiling face and dark cunning have left all she beheld transformed. It, this god, has guided your straying feet onward with only the revelation of the next day&apos;s happenings as your goal. You have wrought change as change will alongside your companions. And such change is always for the better, just as action is better than inaction. You know this well.

An instigator among your allies, you move the tale ever forward. The Traveler&apos;s voice always calls you onward, from over the next hill or through the next door. With cunning, you rely on the strengths of you and your allies, and you use them all to manipulate your foes into the weakest position. What you lack, you make up for with resourcefulness, unpredictability, and sheer luck.

You are a servant of a deity of luck, and you completely trust your own good fortune. As a symbol of your devotion to chance, you always carry a set of dice with you. When in doubt, you trust the dice to determine your actions. Just like the wind, you can be gentle and complacent or a dangerous storm capable of destroying those who stand in your way. Although you are always unpredictable, you can be a brave and loyal companion; fortune brought your company together, after all, and you know better than most that great deeds often flow from unlikely friendships or chance meetings.

You are probably a worshiper of Avandra or a similar deity. Your purpose is to inspire people to be daring, to take chances and seize opportunities, for those who take no risks never realize their full potential. In battle, you have learned to rely on chance. You are a potent combatant when luck favors you.
Although you might not represent the typical image of a divine servant, you are nonetheless a faithful devotee of your deity and your beliefs. You have little regard for the strictures of formal worship—you&apos;re more likely to be found gambling in a tavern than praying in a temple. But when chance leads you to down the path to adventure or into a situation that demands action, you don&apos;t hesitate to join the fight. After all, that&apos;s what&apos;s the dice told you to do.

You can store and channel the entropic flux that surrounds you. This barely controlled chaos is represented by a pool of entropy points. Your pool has 0 entropy points at the end of a short rest or an extended rest. Whenever you make an attack roll and miss, you add 1 entropy point to this pool.

Once per encounter as a free action, before you make an attack roll using an arcane attack power, you can roll a d6 and add the result to that attack roll.
