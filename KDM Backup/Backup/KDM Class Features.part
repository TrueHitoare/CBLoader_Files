Warlocks manipulate arcane power, as wizards do, but their conduit to that power is vastly different. For a warlock, it's as much about who you know as what you know—and in effect, the two are the same.
	All warlocks gain access to their power by entering into a pact with some force or entity in which that power rests. In return for their continuing loyalty and service to the source of their power, warlocks become more adept at their craft, and the abilities they bring to the battlefield grow more lethal.
	The type of warlock you can create with this book is the binder.

	A Binder learns to harness the fell energy surrounding her targets so that she can redirect this magical energy into the spells she uses against her hapless enemies, sustaining negative effects she places on them while aiding her allies in applying their own devious tactics to the very same target.  You have this feature in place of the Warlock's Curse feature used as described in the Player's Handbook, but you still meet the prerequiste of Warlock's Curse for the purposes of aquiring feats and paragon paths, and a bane placed with this feature counts as a curse for the purpose of interacting with effects that reference your Warlock's Curse.

	Once per turn as a minor action, you can place a bane on the enemy nearest to you that you can see. Creatures afflicted by a bane take a -2 penalty to all saving throws.
	
	In addition, once per round as a free action you can designate a creature you can see that you have applied a bane to. That creature makes a saving throw. If it fails, one effect on that creature that would fade at the end of your turn instead fades at the end of your next turn. Otherwise, the effect fades at the end of your turn as normal.
  
	A bane remains in effect until the end of the encounter. You can place a bane on multiple enemies over the course of an encounter; each bane requires the use of a minor action. Placing a bane removes any banes already on that creature.

Once per encounter you can invoke divine power, filling yourself with the might of your patron deity. With the divine might you invoke you can wield special powers. You can also learn other uses for this feature; for instance, the divinity feats grant characters with access to the Channel Divinity class feature the ability to use additional special powers.
Regardless of how many different uses for Channel Divinity you know, you can use only one such ability per encounter. The special ability or power you invoke works just like your other powers.

Many new paladin powers and some of the new feats in this book subject a target to your divine sanction. Being subject to it means the target is marked by you for a duration specified in the description of the power or feat. Unless otherwise noted, the mark ends before the specified duration if someone else marks the target.
Until the mark ends, the target takes radiant damage equal to 5 + your Charisma modifier the first time each round it makes an attack that doesn&apos;t include you as a target. The damage increases to 10 + your Charisma modifier at 11th level and 15 + your Charisma modifier at 21st level.
Divine sanction is meant to complement divine challenge. You can use divine challenge to mark one creature and use divine sanction to mark others. Divine sanction has fewer restrictions than divine challenge so that you can easily use the two in concert.


PALADINS AND DEITIES
As fervent crusaders in their chosen cause, paladins must choose a deity. Paladins choose a specific faith to serve, as well as an alignment. You must choose an alignment identical to the alignment of your patron deity; a paladin of a good deity must be good, a paladin of a lawful good deity must be lawful good, and a paladin of an unaligned deity must be unaligned. Evil and chaotic evil paladins do exist in the world, but they are almost always villains, not player characters.
	Paladins are not granted their powers directly by their deity, but instead through various rites performed when they first become paladins. Most of these rites involve days of prayer, vigils, tests and trials, and ritual purification followed by a knighting ceremony, but each faith has its own methods. This ceremony of investiture gives a paladin the ability to wield divine powers. Once initiated, the paladin is a paladin forevermore. How justly, honorably, or compassionately the paladin wields those powers from that day forward is up to him, and paladins who stray too far from the tenets of their faith are punished by other members of the faithful.

Good, Lawful Good, and Unaligned Deities
&lt;table&gt;Deity	Alignment	Areas of Influence
Avandra	Good	Change, luck, trade, travel
Bahamut	Lawful Good	Justice, honor, nobility, protection
Corellon	Unaligned	Arcane magic, spring, beauty, the arts
Erathis	Unaligned	Civilization, invention, laws
Ioun	Unaligned	Knowledge, prophecy, skill
Kord	Unaligned	Storms, strength, battle
Melora	Unaligned	Wilderness, sea
Moradin	Lawful Good	Creation, artisans, family
Pelor	Good	Sun, summer, agriculture, time
Raven Queen	Unaligned	Death, fate, winter
Sehanine	Unaligned	Trickery, moon, love, autumn&lt;/table&gt; </specific>
      <specific name="Implement"> Paladins make use of holy symbols to help channel and direct their divine powers. A paladin wearing or holding a magic holy symbol can add its enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls to powers that have the implement keyword. Without a holy symbol, a paladin can still use these powers, but he or she doesn&apos;t gain the bonus provided by the magic implement.
	A holy avenger, a special magic weapon, can also be used as an implement for paladin powers, as well as paladin paragon path powers. These weapons are highly sought after by paladins. </specific>

	To you is given the responsibility to unflinchingly stand before an enemy&apos;s charge, smiting them with your sword while protecting your allies with your sacrifice. Where others waver and wonder, your motivation is pure and simple, and your devotion is your strength. Where others scheme and steal, you take the high road, refusing to allow the illusions of temptation to dissuade you from your obligations.
	Take up your blessed sword and sanctified shield brave warrior, and charge forward to hallowed glory!

  Until the mark ends, the target takes radiant damage equal to 5 + your Charisma modifier the first time each round it makes an attack that doesn’t include you as a target. The damage increases to 10 + your Charisma modifier at 11th level and 15 + your Charisma modifier at 21st level.

Though most people associate the Feywild with arcane magic, it is also home to some of the most pristine regions of natural growth across all of the planes. Primeval forests sit untouched by civilization since their creation, alongside mountainsides and hilltops upon which no intelligent being has ever set foot. It should be no surprise that there are those who have chosen a life of protection and guardianship over the natural treasures of the plane.
As with all druids, protectors are the masters of The magic first shared with mortals by the primal spirits. The primal spirits might dwell chiefly in the world, but the druids of the Feywild hear their call and heed their guidance even in the fey realm. Though it might seem as though the presence of the primal spirits in the Feywild would be at a diminished level, in truth primal magic is often among the most effective tools to use in a plane infused with arcane magic. Where many of the dangers of the Feywild have evolved over the eons to deal with the omnipresent nature of arcane threats, primal magic is still untamed and unanticipated by most creatures of the plane.
As a protector, you learned your primal magic from a druid circle, which trained you to protect nature and punish those that would do it harm. By ensuring that the land, the water, and the sky inhabited by ihe primal spirits is protected, you become a staunch defender of those who live in harmony with nature and show respect for their natural surroundings.
You might go out into the world to seek new experiences and powerful artifacts of primal magic. Though you will stray far from your druid circle in the course of your adventures, your efforts reflect on its goals, and you will use the knowledge it has granted you to battle despoilers and defilers throughout the world and across the planes.

However, the druids of your circle serve a different entity as they revere and protect the natural world.
	  A druid circle might be a secret society of masters of primal magic, congregating to enact an agenda known only to themselves. A circle is just as likely to devote itself solely to the communities that arise along the fringe of the wilderness, acting as mystics and advisors while they channel the wisdom of the natural world. Whatever its motive and structure, each druid circle is known for the wisdom of its older members, whose counsel is sought by influential members of all cultures and races.
	  A druid circle has a hierarchy much like that of a religious organization. At 1st level, you are an initiate of your circle. As you gain levels, you improve your standing. Even as your adventuring career brings you experience and prestige, it grants you influence with your fellow druids. With the growth of your mastery of primal magic, you gain greater understanding of the secrets kept by your order. Many druid circles guard mysteries of primal power said to have been handed down in the first days following the Dawn War.

      <Category> 1 </Category>
      <specific name="Short Description"> Gain augmentable at-wills instead of encounter powers. </specific>
      <specific name="Level"> 1 </specific>
      <rules>
         <grant name="ID_INTERNAL_INTERNAL_AUGMENT_POWERS" type="Internal" />
      </rules>
Through discipline and careful study, you have mastered a form of psionic magic that offers greater versatility than other characters command. You know a broad array of at-will powers, each of which is a conduit through which you can pour as much or as little psionic energy as you choose. You channel psionic energy into a reservoir of personal power—represented in the game as power points—that you can use to augment your at-will attack powers, replacing the encounter attack powers that other characters use.
	
Because of this class feature, you acquire and use powers in a slightly different manner from how most other classes do.
	
At-Will Attack Powers: At 1st level, you choose two at-will attack powers and one daily attack power from your class, but you don&apos;t start with any encounter attack powers from your class. You can instead augment your class at-will attack powers using power points. These powers have the augmentable keyword.
	
You gain new at-will attack powers from this class, instead of new encounter attack powers, as you increase in level. At 3rd level, you choose a new at-will attack power from this class. At 7th, 13th, 17th, 23rd, and 27th level, you can replace one of your at-will attack powers with another one of your level or lower. Both powers must be augmentable and from this class.
	
Power Points: You start with 2 power points. You gain 2 additional power points at 3rd and 7th level, and 1 additional power point at 13th level. If you gain power points from another source (such as your paragon path), add them to your power point total. You can use your power points to augment any augmentable power you have, regardless of how you gained the power.
	
You regain all your power points when you take a short or an extended rest.

&lt;table&gt;Level	At-Will Attack Powers	Power Points
1	Choose two	Gain 2
3	Choose one	Gain 2 (4 total)
7	Replace one	Gain 2 (6 total)
13	Replace one	Gain 2 (8 total)
17	Replace one	— (8 total)
21	—	— (8 total)
23	Replace one	— (8 total)
27	Replace one	— (8 total)&lt;/table&gt;

The Augmentable Keyword
A power that has the augmentable keyword has optional augmentations, which you can use at the cost of power points. An augmentable power follows these rules, unless the power&apos;s description says otherwise.
	
Decide First: You must decide whether and how to augment an augmentable power when you choose to use the power, before you make any attack rolls or apply any of the power&apos;s effects.
	
Power Point Cost: An augmentation specifies its cost in power points. For example, “Augment 1” means you must spend 1 power point to use an augmentation. You must spend the required power points when you decide to use the augmentation.
	
One at a Time: You can use only one of a power&apos;s augmentations at a time, so you can&apos;t, for example, spend 3 power points to gain both the 1-point and the 2-point augmentation for a single power.
	
Replace Base Effects: When you augment a power, any change to the power is noted in the augmentation and replaces specific entries in the base power. An augmented version of a power is otherwise identical to the base power.
	
At-Will Attack Powers: When a power or some other effect lets you use an at-will attack power, you can choose to use one of your augmentable at-will attack powers, but you must use it unaugmented.
	
When a racial trait grants you an at-will attack power of your choice and you choose an augmentable at-will attack power, the power loses its augmentations. However, the power does not lose the augmentable keyword. This means the power is unaugmented when you use it, unless you augment it by some other means.

Sha'irs cull magical energy from the Elemental Chaos to power their spells. Rather than pore over ancient formulas and techniques, these wizards bargain with elemental powers for the magical knowledge they need. Sha'irs do not deal directly with these powers; instead, they rely on proxies, elemental spirits called gen servants, to negotiate on their behalf. Dispatching these servants to the Elemental Chaos each day, a sha'ir replenishes the necessary power and information to wield the forces of creation.
	Their unconventional methods, combined with their reputation for consorting with dangerous, often violent, powers, place sha'irs on the fringes of the magical world. Other wizards regard sha'irs with scorn and distrust, believing that they cheat by circumventing the arduous training and research wizards must typically undergo. This mistrust stems from ignorance, however, for even though a sha'ir draws magic from a gen servant, a foundation in arcane training is necessary to wield the power he or she gains.
	Since sha'irs do not clutter their minds with mystical formulas and arcane utterances, they have wider access to spells than other wizards enjoy. They need only know a spell's basic structure to request it from their gen servants. The gen servant then vanishes into the Elemental Chaos, where it bargains with more powerful elemental lords and creatures to acquire the spell the sha'ir seeks and then returns without fail to provide its master with the energy and means to cast the spell. So even though sha'irs do not employ spellbooks, they have access to the full expanse of wizards' most powerful and versatile spells.
	The elemental powers that lend magical knowledge and energy to sha'irs do not do so without an expectation of recompense. Sha'irs often take up the adventurer's life for this reason. They work in the world and beyond as representatives, agents, and servants of their elemental masters. Many times a sha'ir does not even realize that his or her actions are furthering some elemental being's designs, and what might seem to be a normal expedition into the unknown could have consequences not realized for years to come.

    <Flavor> Elemental magic bows to no mortal master. Only those steeped in elemental energy or who can broker with the elemental powers can coax forth its magic. You enlist the aid of a minor elemental spirit, a gen servant, to keep you supplied with the magical energy you need to cast your spells.

By spending 1 hour of meditation with a chosen light or heavy blade, you forge a special bond with the weapon. As a minor action, you can call your bonded weapon to your hand if you have line of effect to it.

You can forge a bond with a different blade using the same meditation process (for instance, if you acquire a new blade that has magical abilities). If you forge a bond with a different blade, the old bond dissipates.

If your bonded weapon is broken or damaged, you can recreate the weapon from a fragment as a standard action. (This process automatically destroys any other fragments of the weapon in existence, so you can&apos;t use it to create multiple copies of a broken weapon.)

Part religion, part ritual, and all mystery, witchcraft is an ancient practice that came about in an age before arcane magic was studied, institutionalized, and etched in writing, when monstrous titans ruled over creation and the secret of making fire was yet undiscovered. In this chaotic dark age, the gods had little influence on the titans' world. Instead of seeking their aid, the primitive peoples called out to the night for protection and power, and a voice from the darkness answered. Those who accepted its arcane gifts became the first witches, and they wielded such power as only immortals had known-seen by some jealous gods as an affront that they have never forgiven.
	Witches gain their power from a patron who instructs them by way of a mystical familiar that comes and goes as it pleases, unbound by the strictures of the material world. The most prevalent patron among witches-the original voice from the darkness-is the moon goddess Sehanine, referred to by witches as simply the Goddess. Other entities have since seen the advantage of imbuing mortals with power, and so your patron might be an archfey, a god, an angel, a primordial, a demon lord, a devil, or another legendary being that believes it can benefit by imbuing you with a gift of arcane prowess. It might prefer to remain anonymous.
	The circumstances by which you obtained your gift can vary widely. Some witches seek out the gift in order to fulfill a personal desire or vendetta, while others were brought up in a coven. Some receive their power after making a pact with a devil, as a warlock might do, and others have it bestowed upon them by a fairy godparent or a witch queen.
	Though witches are common among the fey races in the Feywild, as a witch in the natural world you must be mindful of whom you trust. In the world, common folk fear your kind. Envious wizards refuse to acknowledge you as a peer and would see your wondrous powers vanish from the world, while clerics of jealous gods decree you an unholy menace, sending witch hunters to track you down and destroy you.

		<Category> 1 </Category>
		<Flavor> When you create your witch, you choose a moon coven with which you are affiliated. A moon coven is a loose order of witches that share a philosophy of witchcraft. Each moon coven represents one of two phases of the moon-full or dark (new)-and symbolizes the witch's quintessential attitude toward the application of his or her craft. Each moon coven reflects a member witch's philosophy regarding the use of magic-not necessarily corresponding to the witch's alignment, since witches of all alignments are found in each coven. Nevertheless, a greater number of evil witches gravitate toward the dark moon and its powers over ill fortune and necromancy, whereas good witches more frequently affiliate themselves with the full moon coven and favor its charms and healing magic. 
	Witches are solitary by nature, requiring little arcane instruction beyond the teachings of their familiar, and most prefer to keep their craft secret lest they be targeted by witch hunters. Therefore, a moon coven typically convenes only once during the course of a year, in an isolated location in the wilderness often near standing stones, ley lines, or other sites that thrum with arcane power, on an evening when the coven's moon phase displays in its ideal state in the dark heavens above. Despite their opposing philosophies on witchcraft, the two moon covens sometimes come together on the night of a lunar eclipse, when both are symbolically represented in the night sky. Such meetings occur only when all witches, or the world in which they live, are threatened by forces bent on their extermination. 
	In addition to, or instead of, meeting with their moon coven, some witches gather in local covens attended by witches that inhabit the area. Such local covens are often the way new witches are initiated into the craft, and they show the initiate the way to call on a powerful entity and receive the gift of its power in the form of a familiar. These local covens usually have their own aims and goals related to their immediate surroundings, and might or  right not adhere to the philosophy of either of the moon covens. 
	Many witches learn their craft in isolation, unaware of the presence of the fundamental moon covens, or  even of other witches. Regardless of whether a witch or a local coven identifies with a moon coven, every witch makes a choice concerning the type of witchcraft he or she wants to practice. </Flavor>

	<RulesElement name="Witch's Familiar" type="Class Feature" internal-id="ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4145" source="Heroes of the Feywild">
		<Category> 1 </Category>
		<Flavor> Unlike other wizards, a witch receives the gift of arcane power from a patron such as an archfey, a god, a devil, an angel, a demon, or another powerful being. The witch might or might not be aware of the patron's true identity or its reasons for bestowing power, but such entities always have their reasons, which become clear in time, for good or ill.
	A witch's familiar takes the shape of a Tiny creature, usually a natural or a fey beast such as a cat, a serpent, or a raven, and acts as an intermediary between the witch and the patron of the witch's power. Bound to the witch's soul, this familiar instructs the witch in the use of supernatural powers. 
	Your familiar can have as active a role as you like. Familiars have a distinct personality and a unique relationship with the witches they instruct. Your familiar might provide hints and lore, or it might be a subtle presence in the background that appears and disappears without a sound, if you prefer to downplay its role in your story. </Flavor>

You gain the Arcane Familiar feat and one other familiar feat of your choice as bonus feats. At 6th, 12th, and 18th levels, you gain an additional familiar feat of your choice as a bonus feat.  
	At the end of each extended rest, when you confer with your familiar you can replace one of your wizard daily attack powers or wizard utility powers with another wizard power of the same type. The new power must have a level, and its level must be the same as the old power's level.
	When you reach level 24, your familiar enables you to regain the use of one of your expended wizard encounter attack powers whenever you spend an action point. If you do so, you gain combat advantage against every target of that power the next time you use it during the current encounter.
